**REUM Ltd (London, UK) engagement with Decred (Politeia) to develop the Decredex Exchange**

**REUM Ltd** has created the Decredex to become the official exchange operation for the **Decred Organisation**, offering a dedicated DCR trade pairs environment to allow the Decred community to interact with other currencies via a decentralised exchange. This proposal to Decred means REUM pledges to utilise **Politeia** funding for the cost of the development team, trade partner fees, alongside tech resources to provide for the exchange build, testing and deployment, as well as budget for the global marketing of the **Decredex exchange**.

# What

**Decredex is a decentralised exchange dedicated to the Decred (DCR) currency**

Decredex Exchange - Decred (DCR) coin pairs

BTC/DCR, ETH/DCR, XRP/DCR, LTC/DCR and Fiat/DCR coin pairs to be present on the main GUI of the Decredex exchange.

**Decredex Exchange:**

2.  Fiat to Decred (DCR) conversion, which is a route towards fiat to be spent for DCR in a simple and attractive format. Decred will be the traded currency with the Decredex Exchange. Decredex is capable of cross chain communication utilising the latest in exchange technology. REUM has key partnerships with various exchange software service providers and is ready to develop Decredex with key knowledge related to which development type is best suited to the Decred eco system, which currencies pairs to primarily list upon launch and also how to secure and maintain this exchange as part of this proposal.

1.  REUM will select key developers for its team to provide exchange SaaS solutions and will hire senior developers to bring the Decredex Exchange to reality within 6 months.
2.  Our main markets will be targeted as part of a route to gain new Decred users and encourage traders to use Decredex as their exchange of choice using Decred (DCR) currency to bring in a newly formed exchange of Bitcoin, Altcoin and Fiat as DCR trade options.

Decredex will bring a fresh approach exchange service with the extension of the Decredex cryptocurrency exchange built for the mobile and online user.

-   Decredex exchange offers OTC services for traders seeking to purchase Decred (DCR) in larger amounts via Bitcoin, Altcoin and Fiat currency pairs online and via mobile.
-   Automate trade with BTC, ETH, LTC and other Altcoins pairs towards DCR, alongside a unique stop and start feature for traders with entry for fiat currency users.
-   Decredex offers wallet to wallet transactions using Decrediton GUI for DCR wallet
-   Decredex has cross chain, atomic swap and online/mobile GUI options with the correct technology partners and developers in place to either build from scratch or to integrate services which provide the best version of these elements.
-   Decredex is a project to provide mass adoption encouragement for the Decred currency, marketed with a London based PR Company with experience in generating press for blockchain companies and crypto exchange products/services.
-   Decredex Mobile - Exchange via smartphone.


Decredex Mobile is an extension of the project which will start trading as a fast-growing mobile cryptocurrency exchange under the Decred Organisation’s direction and as an extension of Decredex to bring in the compelling following by some of our professionally targeted marketing efforts concentrated on the Apple and Google application stores, the Decredex mobile exchange connects directly to the Decrediton GUI wallet has the exact same trading rules as the online service, the purpose is to provide additional mass adoption and to assist users to trade cryptocurrencies on the mobile paired with Decred (DCR) to become an integral part of the Decredex exchange network.

**Additional Decredex features:**

Trade DCR pairs with BTC, ETH, LTC and other established coins via mobile

Top 10 market cap coins are chosen as mandatory listing, alongside a set of established, innovative and ‘exchange friendly’ tokens chosen by Decredex, the rest of the coins listed will be chosen by the Decred Community creating a ‘democracy vote’ coin listing system for Decred users to have a say on which coins are listed on Decredex).

Transparent arbitrage fees designed to be competitive with the broader industry, Decredex users (with over 1000 DCR in a registered Decred wallet, can claim $10 dollar for free as part of the Mastercard liquidity/airdrop model), liquidity provision is covered by Nasdaq and our exchange partners...

Trustless, Frictionless transactions as integrated with the Decrediton GUI DCR wallet into the Decredex GUI to be built as easy to navigate, to encourage new users to Decred.

**Additional Online/Mobile features:**

Online trade desk, built utilising elements of the Decrediton GUI as well as the Decred brand/colorway inspiring the Decredex branding and design, Decredex will develop DCR user management tools, portfolio analysis and tutorials within an easy to navigate Decredex trading dashboard.

Mobile application for Decredex, which utilises REUM mobile knowledge (experienced developers of the Mobilise Group, Bitcoin Mobile and other crypto based mobile projects) to create a new mobile application, while engaging with existing Decred Mobile application providers to partner/display apps which will be vetted and user reviews scrutinised to provide us with due diligence while we collate and organise Decred within the mobile applications landscape.

Provides Decredex users with a mobile application which allows DCR trades on the go.

Provides trade desktop download which allows consistent DCR pair options for alternative coins, fiat currency, and stable coins and securities tokens.

**Key OTC features:**

Decred (DCR) trade consulting services

DCR asset management and trading strategies.

Decredex OTC fees designed to be competitive with the broader OTC industry, encouraging small transactions (online/mobile) via the Decredex exchange, but larger transactions using OTC, to provide KYC/AML procedures as a route to regulatory compliance for Decredex’s future plans.

Decredex will eventually provide institutional-sized liquidity towards DCR’s larger OTC trades.

Decredex is totally decentralised - no central authority.

## Why

We believe in the Decred eco-system and have confidence in the Decrediton GUI for the Decredex and we support the Decred community as we continue to grow the legacy of Decred’s pioneers. 

Decrediton GUI and DCR wallet will bring secure transactions to Decredex, as an established coin to compliment the Decredex development roadmap and IP related to fiat to crypto applications and banking licensing, regulatory registration will be now released to integrate within Decredex, allowing Decrediton, DCR to perform wallet to wallet transactions using R&D surrounding DCRD command line adaptation, while trading as an exchange within the UK market, with Nasdaq and the FCA as our first ports of call upon gaining the funding to hire Nasdaq as our compliance team and to register Decredex as an FCA approved exchange.

Decredex plans to provide bridges to address a current lack in fiat, stable coin and asset backed securities token cross communication capability and the Decredex Exchange can fill the gaps related to a lack of visible trade destinations for Decred pairs, as well as solving a current need for all cryptocurrencies to have a fiat to crypto communication tool with Decredex and the securities token R&D, we can cover some important future development curves, early!

*Mass adoption via dedicated DCR exchange*

*Decred Mastercard integration (Already approved)*

*Decred Nasdaq integration (Subject to funding to hire Nasdaq services)*

*Decred FCA Approval for UK (Subject to fund to retain Finsec Associates services)*

*Decred Broker/Dealer license approved for USA (Subject to partnership with Moentum ATS/Spot Quote LLC)*

Mobile app consolidation, vetting and collating all useful projects into all service, while isolating the bad actors in the important mobile app space which is an area of the market which is widely ignored by the majority of established coins including Decred.

**Decredition wallet to wallet transaction development.**

Our ready to work team solves a series of future proofing obstacles to Decred’s growth, for Decrediton to reach its true ‘mass adoption’ potential as already a favoured, respected and ethical wallet on the market and DCR to become a shining example of an exchange coin which assists growth towards new users, while servicing the existing community.
