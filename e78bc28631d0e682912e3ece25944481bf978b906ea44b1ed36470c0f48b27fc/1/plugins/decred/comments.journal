There's no way I'm voting to pay out $1M+ up front, this is going to need to be paid bit-by-bit with milestones of development.\n\nYou've listed various developer pay rates, but it looks like a significant portion of the work will be done at $25/hr. I'm a bit skeptical of quality work being performed at that pay rate.\n\nAlso, as per https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4, it is my understanding that developers (at least those working on Decredition) will need to obtain a DCC. Are you prepared for this?\n\n---\n\nOn a technical side; I quote:\n\n\u003e Decredex is totally decentralised - no central authority.\n\nYet you mention integration with MasterCard, NASDAQ, and other centralized platforms.

He was enthusiastic, had a lot of buzzword-y things to say, and was told about the process to become a contractor for the project.  In the months since then, he and other REUM staff have made zero effort to become contractors.  As such, we have no experience with their work product, and it seems clear they are not interested in engaging with the existing contractor community.\n\nThat said, I see a number of things that are alarming with this proposal.  To avoid being sucked into making an epic and detailed reply to this proposal, I will post my criticisms as a set of succinct bullet points:\n\n* REUM and its staff have made no real effort to engage the existing project contractors or the wider community prior to this proposal.\n* REUM has not demonstrated that any of its staff are capable of generating work product that is useful to the project.\n* REUM does not have a track record of creating open source software.\n* Creating a functional DEX is a technical project.  Nothing in this proposal or on the company website convinces me that REUM has the technical capacity to complete this work.\n* This proposal and the REUM site are full of buzzword-saturated marketing speak.\n* The REUM website has a section called \"Reum Brand Agency\" where they suggest using Instagram models and celebrities to promote ICOs.\n* The claimed partnerships with Nasdaq and Mastercard strike me as a huge overpromise and unrealistic.\n* Attempts to proactively engage regulators in the US and UK strikes me as preemptive and likely to generate negative attention for the project.  The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.\n* The proposed budget suggests to me that REUM has very limited experience running a business.\n* The proposed timeline is unrealistic.\n* Creating a proposal based on an idea and simply pointing at some dev shops when it comes to the implementation runs contrary to the spirit of the project.  The purpose of our proposal system is not to fund \"shower thoughts\".","signature":"fb130b2813b292b22d67569f616772e9d83d2effda2dacb6aef39543225ecb797c8e807dba28d775d0e223093880520c50049aaa28f6bdf22e40a2849113e806","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"4","receipt":"77715914b9df68069f1dd861930d3f45d2bf5eb61be16b92a35d7cacea671c54caa42acaebe7a3b7eb02d33e5386a1ce77600fee8a2511a1258da2d3def6b208","timestamp":1543422922,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But there is little details on the: financial objectives, business strategy, organizational structure, relations with and obligations to DCR, expectations and goals, etc or even what branch is it expected to live one. \n\nWould consider any real meat on this, if the investment asked would have good returns balancing out the risks, e.g. how much of your business would DCR own and how can that be solved legally (if it even can be done)? How quickly would you pay back the investment from DCR treasury and in what terms would this generate revenue towards DCR treasury? \n\nCertainly don’t see it becoming the next Binance or Coinbase. These ships have sailed. Neither is it a decentralised exchange or competing with those in production. What bothers me the most is the real term “decentralised exchange” not being respected here. As if it’s tied to fiat, credit card services etc then by no means can you call it a decentralized exchange. \n\nIf the likely outcome is another low-tier exchange, would be a waste of project funds imo. I see no point in competing with rest of them and can expect huge risks considering how much trust and security issues these various smaller exchanges have in their track record. E.g. this being super close under the Decred umbrella – gets hacked or business goes bad = very bad rep for DCR. Personally I think there are enough of these fishy exchanges that do no favours to the whole cryptospace.\n\n- 4 devs at 25$/h with this scope and schedule seems deeply questionable regarding the weight of responsibility. If they are doing the work on the side, you should provide proof of trackrecord and competence. Who are they, CV's? Quality blockchain devs are scarce, so otherwise without proof it may be whoever, juniors or outsourced indian devs just chopping something together.\n- Combined 245k on marketing/pr before having an actual product is way out of balance (almost 45% of dev budget), and in conflict with DCR’s ethos on actually building the products first.\n- Reference from reum.io/brand-agency – is a kind of marketing approach I personally find repulsive and completely unfitting for anything serious in the financial sector altogether. Keeping in mind DCR’s more conservative approach on marketing and general attitude towards the ICO boom, i’d imagine you should be well aware how conflicting this is?\n- On the same time there is no budget allocated for design and UX. Big red flag, considering this is a far more important factor than marketing/pr. Only need good design and good communications at this stage. \n- Naming/Communication: Decredex – knowing Company Zero has put out earlier post of an upcoming DEX proposal, why even pick such a competing and conflicting name?","signature":"2c11b34a5c2ab02fc33f662bfe21d7fdcaa754f09c47eaefbc47ea353922987d02a36a2e56b95763fe88f6dcb5e7fd4b276212e1497032b67f18bd3049e56105","publickey":"c4936b1db0f0fdbaa1c4271bc5d9382452b85f5bb15df75ea45c8d70a46cb2dc","commentid":"34","receipt":"3480bb608111150ab31ff3f42e9a15a2bafd7bddb577e9927c7dd78e42e1b84fbf64040b3b3fd122108406e3d4c164f3692f07f5c2ce17975a81c99c4835ca05","timestamp":1543586610,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If they are doing the work on the side, you should provide proof of trackrecord and competence. Who are they, CV's? Quality blockchain devs are scarce, so otherwise without proof it may be whoever, juniors or outsourced indian devs just chopping something together.\n    Combined 245k on marketing/pr before having an actual product is way out of balance (almost 45% of dev budget), and in conflict with DCR’s ethos on actually building the products first.\n    Reference from reum.io/brand-agency – is a kind of marketing approach I personally find repulsive and completely unfitting for anything serious in the financial sector altogether. Keeping in mind DCR’s more conservative approach on marketing and general attitude towards the ICO boom, i’d imagine you should be well aware how conflicting this is?\n    On the same time there is no budget allocated for design and UX. Big red flag, considering this is a far more important factor than marketing/pr. Only need good design and good communications at this stage.\n    Naming/Communication: Decredex – knowing Company Zero has put out earlier post of an upcoming DEX proposal, why even pick such a competing and conflicting name?\n\nI will answer these set of points too, please bear with me","signature":"f68ca4fe92362aa61edaaaa8a431c2f1f602a2aade1c1fbaef80b5d6877b3005b6c5bb4200d1eb3266ef48d94c6cee517c6da9019de3f5efa58de177e038e302","publickey":"80d0f5e284283546a78433efa7ccf3c3d07f139a8a6175fca85bef0179e0f141","commentid":"43","receipt":"66ff140e1e688d9ef01523ed62e936ccfe1622383c49210069eb433a7fb37c051db460e8f0053413482ca116e5662a3acf4f663a86cb8d46934f27522c3f4503","timestamp":1543704677,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
