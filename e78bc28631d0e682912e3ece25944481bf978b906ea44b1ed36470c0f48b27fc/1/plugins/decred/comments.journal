There's no way I'm voting to pay out $1M+ up front, this is going to need to be paid bit-by-bit with milestones of development.\n\nYou've listed various developer pay rates, but it looks like a significant portion of the work will be done at $25/hr. I'm a bit skeptical of quality work being performed at that pay rate.\n\nAlso, as per https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4, it is my understanding that developers (at least those working on Decredition) will need to obtain a DCC. Are you prepared for this?\n\n---\n\nOn a technical side; I quote:\n\n\u003e Decredex is totally decentralised - no central authority.\n\nYet you mention integration with MasterCard, NASDAQ, and other centralized platforms.

He was enthusiastic, had a lot of buzzword-y things to say, and was told about the process to become a contractor for the project.  In the months since then, he and other REUM staff have made zero effort to become contractors.  As such, we have no experience with their work product, and it seems clear they are not interested in engaging with the existing contractor community.\n\nThat said, I see a number of things that are alarming with this proposal.  To avoid being sucked into making an epic and detailed reply to this proposal, I will post my criticisms as a set of succinct bullet points:\n\n* REUM and its staff have made no real effort to engage the existing project contractors or the wider community prior to this proposal.\n* REUM has not demonstrated that any of its staff are capable of generating work product that is useful to the project.\n* REUM does not have a track record of creating open source software.\n* Creating a functional DEX is a technical project.  Nothing in this proposal or on the company website convinces me that REUM has the technical capacity to complete this work.\n* This proposal and the REUM site are full of buzzword-saturated marketing speak.\n* The REUM website has a section called \"Reum Brand Agency\" where they suggest using Instagram models and celebrities to promote ICOs.\n* The claimed partnerships with Nasdaq and Mastercard strike me as a huge overpromise and unrealistic.\n* Attempts to proactively engage regulators in the US and UK strikes me as preemptive and likely to generate negative attention for the project.  The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.\n* The proposed budget suggests to me that REUM has very limited experience running a business.\n* The proposed timeline is unrealistic.\n* Creating a proposal based on an idea and simply pointing at some dev shops when it comes to the implementation runs contrary to the spirit of the project.  The purpose of our proposal system is not to fund \"shower thoughts\".","signature":"fb130b2813b292b22d67569f616772e9d83d2effda2dacb6aef39543225ecb797c8e807dba28d775d0e223093880520c50049aaa28f6bdf22e40a2849113e806","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"4","receipt":"77715914b9df68069f1dd861930d3f45d2bf5eb61be16b92a35d7cacea671c54caa42acaebe7a3b7eb02d33e5386a1ce77600fee8a2511a1258da2d3def6b208","timestamp":1543422922,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
