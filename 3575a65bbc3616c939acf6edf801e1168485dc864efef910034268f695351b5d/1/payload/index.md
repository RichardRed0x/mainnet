Testing of the funding-request mechanism by a non expert
**What**

I am proposing a test run of Politeia for funding proposals, with the deliverable being a report. Specifically, I am proposing that I be awarded 0.1 DCR from the Project Treasury. Upon receipt of these funds, I will write up a short description of the process, starting with signing up for Politeia and all the way to the receipt of funds. 

**Why**

I am not involved in the project development, and have not previously experimented with the beta version of Politeia. This will be an experiment in how an uninitiated Decred stakeholder would go through the process of proposing something that requires the disbursement of funds, all the way through the receipt of the funds.

Please note that I am requesting 0.1 DCR, which is a trivial amount. Between the 0.1 DCR sign-up fee and the 0.1 DCR fee to submit a proposal, I will be losing money even if the proposal is funded. The purpose of this is to go through the full process from sign-up to the proposal being funded with effectively no risk to the Treasury, and to provide feedback on the process.

**How**

I have already begun the process of writing down details of my experience, starting with signing up for Politeia. Upon receipt of the funds of 0.1 DCR from the treasury, I will finish up the draft, go through one round of editing, and publish the writeup on the decred subreddit or wherever the community prefers. 

**Who**

I am /u/hashfunction8 on Reddit, and I have been a community member there for over a year. I hold enough DCR for than one ticket, and regularly stake. I have chosen to remain anonymous, and I do not believe that that is an issue for this proposal given the trivial amount of money at stake.

**When**

The writeup will be delivered within 1 week of the proposal being funded.
