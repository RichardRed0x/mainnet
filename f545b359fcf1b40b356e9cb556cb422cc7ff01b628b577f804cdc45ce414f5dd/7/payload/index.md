Baeond: The Futurepunk Autonomous Card Game
# **What**

---

Baeond is a #Futurepunk Living Card Game in which players forge their own cards though play. Each card is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on a native blockchain, minted in a skeleton state. All cards start from an identical point for each player, but some cards are taught Skills and imbued with new traits over time, changing their constitution. One card may have thousands of different playable permutations.

Beyond the rules of the card game itself, the broader metagame is modeled after the success of shared-world looter-shooters in the last 4 years. In games like Destiny, players shoot their way through narrative (PVE) & competitive (PVP) activities to earn in-game items, materials, and more, otherwise known as Loot. *Baeond replaces shooter gameplay with a card game while retaining the hobbyistic nature of looter games that incentivize players to finish collections, complete challenges, creatively customize their avatars, and discover new unique lines of play.*

The global metagame is shaped by player choice. As deck archetypes rise to prominence, the player base will be incentivized to forge key cards that enable counter-archetypes, keeping the metagame fresh and exciting.

# **Why**

---

Games are deeply human constructs. In the last decade, with the rise of mobile & f2p gaming, games have become commoditized as psychological manipulation tools used to capture attention for financial gain. These tactics keep digital games on the cusp of rising to the upper echelons of art alongside music, movies, television, and the written word. Baeond imagines a future where players own their destinies, digitally and socially.

Games as art have a responsibility to reflect to the world a reality they are willing to actualize. We have an opportunity to shift the public perception of online games away from toxicity & tribalism toward altruism & inclusiveness. An undercurrent of optimism gives way to narratives that galvanize and champion the human spirit in all the myriad forms it takes. We are bursting at the seams to share more with you about the world we are building.

## Why Decred?

- *Baeond will fork & prominently place Decred as a technology partner*

    Decred aims to be a store of value; it would not be practical to adopt the features required of a game with its own native chain. We seek an ongoing relationship with the Decred community as we explore the new frontier of decentralized gaming. We foresee a fruitful partnership akin to that of Google's Android & OEM Samsung. We look forward to exploring the space alongside the Decred community and sharing discoveries made along the way. 

    We wholeheartedly agree that good governance is the key to a successful, nimble, adaptable crypto network. We believe the same is true tenfold in decentralized gaming.  With good governance, not only can you have any feature you want, you can give players the agency they so crave in an industry overrun with corporate interests. We aim to treat players more like constituents than customers and champion Decred as the technology that enables us to do so.

- *Baeond will support $DCR LN swaps.*

    We anticipate the Baeond/$DCR to be the primary trading pair against any third party DEX implementations, exposing the crypto community and beyond to the value of an on-chain governance system and a hybrid network.


- *There aren't good crypto games yet.*

    Crypto doesn't understand games yet. We come from games and understand crypto. We are taking a game-first, light touch approach to in-game on-chain interactions, focused on how a governance model can help shift the balance of power in the gaming industry. We cannot overstate how ripe the space is for innovation. There is a massive opportunity to seize, and the next big thing always starts out looking like a toy. All eyes are on games as the next big driver of mass crypto adoption and a high tide raises all ships.

- *Crypto is our killer feature*

    On-chain governance allows us to divorce ourselves from many of the systems entities like Wizards of the Coast are burdened with. Politeia allows us to empower our players to share control over the Baeond minting process while we focus on making the most fun game possible. New staking paradigms allow players to lend each other cards, verify each others' upgrades, and more. We imagine the concept of Proof of Play will help augment and further bolster the already superior security & attack cost a hybrid PoW/PoS network enjoys.

- *Up/Downstream*

    We look forward to maintaining core Decred mechanisms from upstream:

    - Proof of Work/Stake Hybrid
    - On-Chain Ticketing Governance System
    - Politeia Proposal System
    - Future focuses like Privacy features

    We anticipate making modifications to the parameters of these systems to support the game's ruleset. We also anticipate utilizing this opportunity for exploration to experiment with key components of Decred's system:

    - Switching algorithms to target mobile mining
    - Lower blocktime to support more frequent votes and smaller denominations in-game

    If there is demand we are prepared  to backport features we pioneer, like:

    - Support for richer & deeper staking mechanisms
        - Stake against the network with or without time locks for varying purpose and weight
        - Surge incentives for miners, stakers, and players to support the network in times of high load
    - Support for non-fungible tokens

## Airdrop
We're very interested in doing an Airdrop for $DCR holders and are also exploring a [Merkle Mine](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/introducing-the-merklemine/204)-inspired Fairdrop open to holders of $DCR & $BTC. Very interested in hearing from the community on this subject.

# **How**

---

We have been designing Baeond since early 2018. In December, we partnered with Choice Provisions to polish the prototype ruleset for a playable reveal during an early release presale. In early 2019, we'll reveal the rules, along with the first playable prototype featuring 5 preconstructed decks. If players enjoy the game and wish to support development, they can preorder (accepting BTC & $DCR) a preconstructed deck of in-game NFTs for use in the Baeond Alpha Testnet that will go live in tandem with the fiat presale 1-2 months later.

We are requesting 11,000 $DCR disbursed over 7 months to complete the playable Unity prototype shipping in Q3 2019. In Q1 2019, we'll presell ~250,000 preconstructed decks to crypto players, then to fiat players a few months later when the playable prototype & testnet are ready.

We aim to use this infusion as the second half of our Seed raise. Indeed, funds will be used for more than the Engineering budget, but we intend to staff one engineer exclusively with maintaining $DCR changes from upstream. Trusting Decred with its core competency allows us to focus on ours and make the game this technology deserves.

# Updates 1/6/19
---
Hey all! Thank you so much for taking the time to digest this information. I've got a few updates & responses to concerns that have been brought to my attention!

## Open Source

Everything we build on-chain will be open source. Still, Games require surprise & delight; both are impossible without some level of obfuscation. We see a lot of potential having the classified parts of the game using ZK proofs to keep them in-client & on-chain without risking exposing aspects the playerbase hasn't yet discovered. That said, we do not intend to have any game systems that are hidden from the player, so the entirety of the ruleset will be open. That's part of the beauty of the game. We want to build a game we can take to space with us. We can't bring Fortnite; those servers and IP are Epic's. We *can* bring chess; no one owns it. And again, since we're using Baeond as an opportunity to learn about what a Proof of Play protocol would look like, we agree that open source is the way to go. Not to mention, we're terribly curious what will happen when the ruleset is inevitably forked; we imagine it will give rise to other formats and other games. We're totally fine with this because in games, much like in crypto, ideas and mechanics flow like water. They don't belong to anyone because [everything is a remix](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/).

## Structure

We're not planning to offer control to Decred, per se. We see ourselves as an experimental partner to Decred, so maybe referring to 'seed' here is a misnomer. We're not offering equity, we are offering partnership. We are ready to drop preconstructed decks to Decred holders & we think the fallout of not following through on our word is negative incentive enough. We've also considered doing an adjacent Fairdrop inspired by the Livepeer Merkle Mine, but for now, **my gut instinct is to drop a deck to every Decred wallet that has voted at least once.** Deck pricing is currently floating between $20-30 USD/ea in line with most starter decks you can get a hobby shop, so value to holders gets replaced as soon as Testnet launches & decks are dropped. It looks like there are far more than 10,000 voting wallets in the network, so the total value of airdropped decks would exceed our ask of 11K $DCR ($200K USD). Let us know what you think about this airdrop model in the comments, this is something we're very interested in getting feedback on.

# Up/Downstream
---

Just want to take a second here to recognize the request for more specificity with regard to technical details. I wish I had more specific lines of code to augment these technical goals, but we are still very much early days on the technical side. The game itself has taken the bulk of our attention because even with all this cool tech, the only thing that matters at the end of the day is that people want to play this game because it is fun. We're here to work alongside Decred and receive guidance on our technical choices from folks who have far more expertise in the space than we do.

## NFT Support

We need to build in support for NFTs. This is one of the very first things we're doing as we speak, so that would be the first thing we can backport. We're looking at the 721 spec as a jumping off point. We'd target support for existing NFT standards in Decred wallets, but would very much want to work together on the broader implications of NFTs being minted on a Decred sidechain. This is also something we see as a step towards turing completion. Anything we can do to support other developers building against Decred is a boon.

## $DCR in-game

We've definitely considered $DCR in-game, but it really takes the player out of the world when the assets they use in-game are the same as they'd use when AFK. As it sits right now, there will be many fungible assets in-game used for different purposes, just like in any other looter or MMO (Destiny, Warframe, EVE Online) but no $DCR in-game. What we *can* and will do is:

- Only accept $BTC & $DCR for the crypto sale.
- Support LN Baeond/$DCR swaps from day one of Mainnet launch, so the de facto pair as third party DEX markets pop up will be Baeond/$DCR.

## Politeia

Politeia is the Decred feature that is pivotal to Baeond. Governance is the real magic of what a crypto game can offer, not the tone deaf 'sell your stuff when you're done playing'. We can set an example for the rest of the games space to understand that this technology, when governance is at its core, can help foster a closer connection between player and progenitor.

Game creators have never before had the ability to create games with self-sustaining models without resorting to predatory F2P tactics or cutting deals with publishers. What if the creator could go directly to the playerbase without any middlemen like publishers or storefronts, just like crypto is doing to banks? We want to shift the perception of Decred away from 'second $BTC' to 'first $DCR'. The crypto community is still skeptical of on-chain governance models, but we can prove it in the gaming space where there is a lot more attention, users & use cases to learn & grow against. A real game is the best vehicle to catapult governance to the top of the list of features needed from a future-proof Store of Value. Here are the bits we're targeting to bring value back to Decred:

- We're working on roles that will allow Designers apart from us to contribute cards to the minting cycle.
- If/when we discover a model that works better than the current Politeia model, we can backport it. We think borrowing a few features from feedback sites like Uservoice will go a long way in this context.
- We also think there's a huge need for richer communication on Pi if it is to be the canonical means of communication for the network. When talking topics like spending money, hiring, and more, as close to face-to-face as possible is preferable to a comment thread.
- We're looking to tie Pi directly to our Testnet. Decred's Pi use case is more directed toward initiatives & treasury spend. We also need to use it to allow other designers to contribute to the game which means when their props are approved, the cards they contributed would become available in the next Testnet mint. All of this work can be backported to allow Pi to effectively serve as cryptographically signed version control, and we see that as terribly useful for Decred's future.
- The user experience of Pi will need to change a lot for us, so all the modifications to the front end & the lifts that enable richer input are all available to backport.

# In Closing
---
We came to Politeia not just because we believe in Decred, but we were also very much encouraged to do so by our backers who are also backers of Decred. We hope that the feedback on the proposal from here on out will be more constructive than the last week was. Proposals need to be met with an open minded, pragmatic, informative and respectful approach by all, including the submitter. A respectful open discussion is the only way Politeia will work.

Baeond will be built whether or not this proposal passes, but a partnership would immensely benefit the Decred network based on the notion of governance in games alone. Fortnite just had yet another balance issue; now that they've hit peak Fortnite, they're looking to build on the game, but the Battle Royale formula was an afterthought to Epic and now they're scrambling, throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. They already had to pull a sword because it was overpowered, and that was just because it wasn't fun! This kind of move would decimate an in-game economy and if those in-game assets are crypto assets, then there's no difference between a distributed game and Acitvision making unilateral decisions if the game designer can modify the rules & pieces to suit their needs. More and more, games are becoming 'third spaces' to compliment work/home. The more time we spend in these virtual worlds, the more apparent a need for a governance model becomes.

Crypto networks to date have implemented game theory without considering game design. This is *why* we are building a game. For crypto networks to begin to thrive, they need more than just a gamified free market. Game design is our core competence, so it is where we have spent the most time. The paradigms that we implement are a breeding & proving ground for mechanisms that could make their way into the Decred network topography. I can't overstate how big a deal this is. Whether it's dealing with voter apathy, ticket pool size, or exploring new staking models & incentives, we think the answers lie in honoring crypto networks as games, and doubling down on the design of their mechanics & systems. Partnering with us to pave the way for the future of distributed gaming will directly contribute to Decred's recognition outside of the crypto sphere, its price, and its adoption.

We do appreciate our ask is substantial, but we are breaking new ground and we need to do it right. We can't afford to be 'just another crypto game'. We have an opportunity to show the world how this is done, and we have the right team and the right technology to do it. We hope you'll join us!
