Baeond: The Futurepunk Card Game
# **What**

---

Baeond is a #Futurepunk Living Card Game in which players forge their own cards though play. Each card is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on a native blockchain, minted in a skeleton state. All cards start from an identical point for each player, but some cards are taught Skills and imbued with new traits over time, changing their constitution. One card may have thousands of different playable permutations.

Beyond the rules of the card game itself, the broader metagame is modeled after the success of shared-world looter-shooters in the last 4 years. In games like Destiny, players shoot their way through narrative (PVE) & competitive (PVP) activities to earn in-game items, materials, and more, otherwise known as Loot. *Baeond replaces shooter gameplay with a card game while retaining the hobbyistic nature of looter games that incentivize players to finish collections, complete challenges, creatively customize their avatars, and discover new unique lines of play.*

The global metagame is shaped by player choice. As deck archetypes rise to prominence, the player base will be incentivized to forge key cards that enable counter-archetypes, keeping the metagame fresh and exciting.

# **Why**

---

Games are deeply human constructs. In the last decade, with the rise of mobile & f2p gaming, games have become commoditized as psychological manipulation tools used to capture attention for financial gain. These tactics keep digital games on the cusp of rising to the upper echelons of art alongside music, movies, television, and the written word. Baeond imagines a future where players own their destinies, digitally and socially.

Games as art have a responsibility to reflect to the world a reality they are willing to actualize. We have an opportunity to shift the public perception of online games away from toxicity & tribalism toward altruism & inclusiveness. An undercurrent of optimism gives way to narratives that galvanize and champion the human spirit in all the myriad forms it takes. We are bursting at the seams to share more with you about the world we are building.

## What's in it for Decred?

- *Baeond will prominently place Decred as a technology partner*

    Decred aims to be a store of value; it would not be practical to adopt the features required of a game with its own native chain. We seek an ongoing relationship with the Decred community as we explore the new frontier of decentralized gaming. We foresee a fruitful partnership akin to that of Google's Android & OEM Samsung. We look forward to exploring the space alongside the Decred community and sharing discoveries made along the way. 

    We wholeheartedly agree that good governance is the key to a successful, nimble, adaptable crypto network. We believe the same is true tenfold in decentralized gaming.  With good governance, not only can you have any feature you want, you can give players the agency they so crave in an industry overrun with corporate interests. We aim to treat players more like constituents than customers and champion Decred as the technology that enables us to do so.

- *There aren't good crypto games yet.*

    Crypto doesn't understand games yet. We come from games and understand crypto. We are taking a game-first, light touch approach to in-game on-chain interactions, focused on how a governance model can help shift the balance of power in the gaming industry. We cannot overstate how ripe the space is for innovation. There is a massive opportunity to seize, and the next big thing always starts out looking like a toy. All eyes are on games as the next big driver of mass crypto adoption and a high tide raises all ships.

- *Baeond will support $DCR LN swaps.*

    We anticipate the Baeond/$DCR to be the primary trading pair against any third party DEX implementations, exposing the crypto community and beyond to the value of an on-chain governance system and a hybrid network.

- *Crypto is our killer feature*

    On-chain governance allows us to divorce ourselves from many of the systems entities like Wizards of the Coast are burdened with. Politeia allows us to empower our players to share control over the Baeond minting process while we focus on making the most fun game possible. New staking paradigms allow players to lend each other cards, verify each others' upgrades, and more. We imagine the concept of Proof of Play will help augment and further bolster the already superior security & attack cost a hybrid PoW/PoS network enjoys.

- *Up/Downstream*

    We look forward to maintaining core Decred mechanisms from upstream:

    - Proof of Work/Stake Hybrid
    - On-Chain Ticketing Governance System
    - Politeia Proposal System
    - Future focuses like Privacy features

    We anticipate making modifications to the parameters of these systems to support the game's ruleset. We also anticipate utilizing this opportunity for exploration to experiment with key components of Decred's system:

    - Switching algorithms to target mobile mining
    - Lower blocktime to support more frequent votes and smaller denominations in-game

    If there is demand we are prepared  to backport features we pioneer, like:

    - Support for richer & deeper staking mechanisms
        - Stake against the network with or without time locks for varying purpose and weight
        - Surge incentives for miners, stakers, and players to support the network in times of high load
    - Support for non-fungible tokens

## Airdrop
In addition, all non-VSP $DCR wallets that have voted at least 5 times by the time of the snapshot will receive an airdrop of a randomly selected starter deck. We are also exploring a [Merkle Mine](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/introducing-the-merklemine/204)-inspired Fairdrop open to holders of $DCR & $BTC.

# **How**

---

We have been designing Baeond since early 2018. In December, we partnered with Choice Provisions to polish the prototype ruleset for a playable reveal during an early release presale. In early 2019, we'll reveal the rules, along with the first playable prototype featuring 5 preconstructed decks. If players enjoy the game and wish to support development, they can preorder (accepting BTC & $DCR) a preconstructed deck of in-game NFTs for use in the Baeond Alpha Testnet that will go live in tandem with the fiat presale 1-2 months later.

We have secured $200,000 in Seed and are pursuing an additional $200,000 to complete the playable prototype. In early 2019, we'll presell ~250,000 preconstructed decks to crypto players, then to fiat players a few months later when the playable prototype & testnet are ready.

We are requesting 13,000 $DCR disbursed over 7 months. We aim to use this infusion as the second half of our Seed raise. Indeed, funds will be used for more than the Engineering budget, but we intend to staff one engineer exclusively with maintaining $DCR changes from upstream. Trusting Decred with its core competency allows us to focus on ours and make the game this technology deserves.

# **Who**

## Playproof LLC

We are a Delaware-based LLC helmed by [Mark Burstiner](https://twitter.com/markb), tech industry veteran, YouTube personality, and gaming trailblazer. Mark's previous endeavor, FTW, sought to free players' saves from the silos of the consoles they're enjoyed on. We have been thinking about the problem of storing players' saves since 2009 and it turns out all those lessons are transferrable to digital assets; items we earn in-game *are* our saves. 

## [Beto Garcia](https://github.com/josebetomex)

Beto is a seasoned builder & CTO. Built Hostspot, a wifi + geo analytics platform with 1M+ downloads. Founder of Andia, a Proof of ID protocol; use case app, Pruvyt, uses non-identifying biometric vectors to enable businesses to interact with customers' data without revealing their identity. Bet would be the primary beneficiary of the grant from Decred. We also have one other engineer onboard who is still working on other projects and cannot currently be named. This grant would allow us to bring both on full time.

## [Choice Provisions](https://totallychoice.com/)

## Partners

We are thrilled to work with the Decred team and are eager to work with Ditto to seize this moment in crypto history. Mark is currently based in Philadelphia and makes frequent trips to NYC; he looks forward to meeting over a slice of pep from Vinnie's. We're also open to contractual agreements with stakeholders; we have a phenomenal legal team.
