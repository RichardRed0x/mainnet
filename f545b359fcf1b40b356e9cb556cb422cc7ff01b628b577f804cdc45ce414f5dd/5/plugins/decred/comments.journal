I am not perfect myself, but I'd implore you to deploy empathy \u0026 think harder about the human at the other end of your keyboard. I think it's pretty apparent that we have a full team who have all put immense effort into the project to date and for you to suggest that we think Decred is a charity we can just sign up for when we're ready to make it rain is a straw man argument at best. As you'll start to see on the vlog as episodes go up, we've been working on this proposal for ~two months. It would be much appreciated if folks could read the proposal thoroughly enough not to need to be informed of its contents later, after having already responded. I also think the juvenile nature the #proposals room in Slack exhibited was...surprising. It was unbecoming of the team, and not what I would expect from the only crypto network with working on-chain governance in production. (since 2013!!)\n\nWe're here in good faith to take and integrate feedback because we believe in the ethos of Decred, too! I can certainly appreciate a bit of sticker shock; making games is expensive! We really think that setting an example for the games industry to turn their gaze our way will propel Decred \u0026 the entire crypto ecosystem further forward at faster pace than we've seen to date. As I say in the proposal, a high tide raises all ships: we are stronger when we work together! We do not consider ourselves a private business any more than Company Zero was at Decred's inception, and we intentionally only referenced the Airdrop \u0026 Fairdrop plans, imagining myriad more models would be suggested by the community as some helpful folks have!\n\nWe've found when studying the crypto space in macro that games are how the rest of the world is looking toward the space to prove its worth and spur mass adoption. (everyone here knows sound money is reason enough, but most need more than that) Some game developers are interested, but the space is still so nascent that many of the major concepts are still so obtuse, and games don't yet support or even understand the infrastructure to support them. To reference [Dani Grant](https://twitter.com/thedanigrant), [platforms follow the application](https://www.usv.com/blog/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase). We have a long view; Baeond is dogfood for a larger Proof of Play protocol that we anticipate will enable industry veteran game designers to create permissionless \u0026 autonomous games. We're here for the long haul and think Decred is the wagon to hitch to.\n\nWe possess an agility Decred does not when it comes to experimentation, so we're looking to join forces and grow alongside, not unlike how MimbleWimble/Grin has been handling [forks](https://mw-w.ink/leer/index.php/flavors/). Someone in the Slack made the comparison to this prop effectively being a satellite dev team Decred would be funding, and yes! That's exactly the ticket! We don't see any value in shouting at the team to support features we'd need for a game \u0026 we don't see a lot of promise in other base layer projects just yet. The space is ripe for experimentation! We want to help start a more nimble arm of development around Decred. We really don't think anything could be healthier for the Decred network at this stage in time. \n\nFor now, I'm updating the prop to reflect an ask of 11K $DCR disbursed over 7 months. I'm working on a quick writeup for the end of the week on some of the specifics of we're doing to support LN swaps with DCR, NFT support, a Politeia facelift/UX breakdown(Hi, design team, if you're reading! I'll be reaching out to you on Github soon!), and a few very new, very untested ideas we look forward to putting through their paces. \n\nIn the meantime, looking forward to answering as many questions as I can about the project!","signature":"bf5153ef7769bd534980446d7ab8669fff396feeb023560045b789cf53ade055f88c03cc56cc43c25e576903924cebf5efd156b9c45ba14d0b355cfd60ffe50a","publickey":"60e2e94c873e505adb18ec7b8fe78b58593adf7a6cb6e1b952a70505006e32b4","commentid":"11","receipt":"b6055760668e034962f5e1d16642892dc4e48dbab5524bd6dba39bf0b89e16d6ac41b93ea4e951dcf5f2972f58b21d5c83b35c9270f19bdda737188d5f829c0f","timestamp":1546386902,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I believe many recent proposals exhibit the same issues as this one.\n\nThe treasury is not a venture capital fund, politeia isn't a platform to allocate grants. And stakeholders are not a group of investors looking to spend money on random cool ideas (even if they are really cool).\n\nThe treasury is a precious and fragile insurance policy. It's the energy source to keep Decred evolving, growing staying secure, implementing required changes, and staying relevant in the future ahead.\n\nAt the moment, the primary question that anyone who want to make a proposal should ask beforehand IMO is:  Who is the primary beneficiary of this proposal? \"  If the answer is not Decred or the Decred ecosystem, or the Decred Community,  expect strong opposition from stakeholders..\n\nThat's how I view the treasury and its purpose. That being said,  I could envision within a few years, when things are going nicely and we have a better picture of our treasury and operation costs, a proposal being made to set aside a small % of the treasury specifically in a separate fund that itself,  could be used to allocate grants, donations, or to fund various ventures like this one. \n\nBut it's way too early for that, and way to risky. It could put us in a position where allocated funds to a \"cool idea\" would hinder Decred's future development.","signature":"bd8f96cdc91bd58d2e7676e2dde292b90af4eedc1b5b5f2849b29c24a5479bb79ae5b4158c5e60eaedf5fa4f2cfe9a29855bdd8d31a480f8be4399e2127fc701","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"14","receipt":"30d0e825d5e5160f5d295b45c7d59b3786e0393c1d30712373a23ceca82854dadee0006361dca1350a47c3d5e4d45eb4b4a93fcfbd61ea94c679e79cffd78d02","timestamp":1546395151,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
