Smart Reach Partnership Proposal -- Jan 2019
This proposal is for Decred to enter into paid partnership with Smart Reach. 
This partnership will grant Decred the following:
1 x Monthly State of the project podcast/AMA/ interview
1 x Governance Conference Call per month
5 x adverts within Smart reach releases per month
1 x ITK episode with Tom White of Sky Sports News
Decred logo on all smart reach graphics related to sponsored shows

We believe that the State of the project and Governance conference calls will go a long way towards making your decentralised governance more effective, reduce voter apathy and give proposers a better platform to share their products and ideas. The value of these two items far outweighs the small cost of partnership in our opinion.

Developers corner is a Podcast where CryptoSI quizzes some of the top Developers in the Crypto currency space, and asks them questions based on their actual public githubs and projects that they are building.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOYZv8zi96Q

State of the Project is a Monthly Podcast based on various awesome Crypto projects. The podcast delves into the current status of the projects and gathers news from important team members about the upcoming developments and advances..

**Social Media Following**

Twitter combined 8K+
Facebook combined 3k+
Youtube -100 -- Steemit combined 1K+
Instagram -100

Our social media numbers are still low, but considering we have just rebranded totally we should experience a rapid growth in our reach, with Tom whites media connections Our social media reach will be much larger in coming months

----------------------------
**What you will get, in depth**.

1 x Monthly State of the project podcast/AMA/ interview

This will allow you to keep your community updated on developments and progress towards roadmap items, but more than this this allows community members to get involved and ask directions directly to team members and even put forward proposals and make suggestions for the progress of your project.

The podcast will be recorded in Discord using Craig-Bot, this allows our professional sound engineer to alter each persons individual channel to get the best possible quality on a remotely recorded call.  
https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo%C3%A3o-zurzica-90699b91/

Once recorded, calls will be shared in the CMT discord, on youtube and posted to all the popular places that all Smart Reach content is located, this gives your project the opportunity to be seen by people outside of its usual userbase.

1 x Governance Conference Call per month

Decentralised projects are still getting to grips with developing strong social layers for community interaction and tackling voter apathy, currently very few projects dedicate any time to giving their community an audio forum with which to share and investigate proposals. Smart reach through its governance conference call program is doing just that, and the benefits are clear and obvious from the short amount of time they have been incorporated in PIVX, that not only to they help find excellent proposals, but they also help to highlight poor ones and stop the community from misallocating funds or trust.

The governance call will be held in discord and after being recorded will be promoted on facebook and reddit with PAID advertising (cost covered by partnership fee) and the podcast will be uploaded to youtube, itunes spotify and all other serious podcasting hosting arenas. This service is one that is absolutely critical to any serious decentralised governance effort.

5 x adverts within Smart reach releases per month

Smart reach will be releasing plenty of content weekly featuring guests from various projects, these episodes will be listened to and shared by these communities and your project will have a short advert within the content, this is great exposure for your brand a considering these episodes will have paid advertising on facebook reddit and other platforms we expect the reach to be extensive and very well targetted.
Each advert will be recorded in a state of the art studio by Tom White himself and be edited by a professional sound engineer to the highest possible quality. We will clarify the script before hand (please see script below)


Advert script -- (to be decided by Decred community and team, help will be needed)

1 x ITK episode with Tom White of Sky Sports News
Your project will be featured on our flagship podcast free of charge.

Decred logo on all smart reach graphics related to sponsored shows
As well as the audio advert, your logo will also be featured on any graphics made for the show, our professional experienced graphics team are Rhubarb media, an experienced crypto branding company based in canada who have built all of our graphics to the highest standards. You can see for yourself on our thumbnails that our visuals are awesome (we dont like to brag)
