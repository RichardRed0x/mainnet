I have listened to 12 minutes of the PIVX Alliance governance call, and snippets of ITK Crypto in reaching this opinion.\n\nThe governance call to speak to representatives of each proposal would add significant overhead to the proposal submission process. I generally prefer to avoid conference calls, and would not be keen to see one like this become an important part of Decred's proposal governance. \n\nIf these calls were happening and paid for by the Treasury they would influence observers' perception of Politeia, so the stakes would be fairly high. Proposal owners may feel compelled to participate as part of the submission process if the call is treasury funded. \n\nIn the end, the utility of any audio format like this would be determined by whether stakeholders listen in and value the information. I haven't seen any evidence of demand for a show like this yet.","signature":"29b54e80f815c6d6a521a9f43ce35bf2fc8b70c8e77b1bdd72100c11d4f9ac210ca8d943c1bdb598830bd93bc9ac562395fa1303ae6330e45372da20d42d5c09","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"ff5be8d52f7deb301bb83c06a6b09ddcc6cab899e20e29032cb5a2796255195d5b3b91b35e49d27f006b8c32ec9685167890a12124f6c92a455a39584b18ba0c","timestamp":1546385060,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
