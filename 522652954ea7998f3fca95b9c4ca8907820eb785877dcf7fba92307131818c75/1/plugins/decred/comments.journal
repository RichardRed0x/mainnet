In fact, all VSPs that Decrediton blesses are specifically required to have multiple geographically separated servers\n\nFor those reasons, I'm in favor of the proposed terminology changes.","signature":"b08f895d45fce6004e374b075ef1be2581509abb7d7ca5bd3ec8d9455ff4a34fc7aa402411417b06a1dccb1cde44fe5193f4392ea6aa21bfe46d03385223f10c","publickey":"937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","commentid":"2","receipt":"6a2b40e3adc374c41ac903badd0a8845922795b05c1f9aeb6e35b1dfff81488fb960c486c57f2f12c066eb9308f13d15a3adb3d12548b3ff9b3ac3c8704e1509","timestamp":1539907444,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
