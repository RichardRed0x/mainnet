I would like this to pass on to the voting stage, at least after a few more stakeholders chip in with their views, in order to get a better estimate on both costs and contractors.\n\nConversely, given that the bulk of ATMs are based in the North American continent, an alternative effort could be collaborating with Point of Sale terminal companies which cater to a larger number of geographies, and potentially wider network effects. Both avenues could be considered and are not mutually exclusive. Hence, I would like to hear more opinions from other stakeholders.","signature":"a3ffbbd9956533aa59ddf041f74c6fa87d64cc48ab9e6b48a4a7bbb1d3c5d60d1502da09362c3e435def2b089c0f139af8274c2c3979c594a3e7db3714ed2e0a","publickey":"b23de44909614c81f567a3c14a223a023c092bed742ae511c031adeb7509e8d8","commentid":"1","receipt":"e5f61b1077ecdc080e9c4f0e9cf1a7ae7925d74e2e4c2670a30cb5292a4a8ddca5b12f7c9a5c973a1bcb97067dcaab41fcaa377d287405e513efc4ff6366b00c","timestamp":1550677397,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I remember, for instance, being new to crypto, and buying LTC without knowing anything about it, simply because it appeared on Coinbase. That was a good decision. I don't think you're going to get the full on \"Coinbase effect\" here, but I do think DCR being on a platform with a wide reach raises awareness and credibility, and could lead people to buy a little just to speculate. \n\nI'm not in a position to estimate how much this usage will raise the price of DCR in the long run, but the cost does seem very reasonable considering the amount of work. Also, is this a rare project where we can actually measure ROI? In addition to the harder to quantify \"brand awareness\", can we also track how much DCR is being bought through the ATMs?","signature":"93ffa26fe0752d724acb7d79355c30678bbde26e97c674b0b530ea3824ad0a7628ad44a0b5ed5a42ce21425a75969cd4637df028f5152f57f6dd3b272e5cb50e","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"2","receipt":"b204ead466fd51946210bd192be7579278a87c16252eed4e3171fb50bcb745425cf4d474811ac863c07f55ed685bcf8dba6d82a027a9f45907efb1432bdfb507","timestamp":1550691598,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
