I would like this to pass on to the voting stage, at least after a few more stakeholders chip in with their views, in order to get a better estimate on both costs and contractors.\n\nConversely, given that the bulk of ATMs are based in the North American continent, an alternative effort could be collaborating with Point of Sale terminal companies which cater to a larger number of geographies, and potentially wider network effects. Both avenues could be considered and are not mutually exclusive. Hence, I would like to hear more opinions from other stakeholders.","signature":"a3ffbbd9956533aa59ddf041f74c6fa87d64cc48ab9e6b48a4a7bbb1d3c5d60d1502da09362c3e435def2b089c0f139af8274c2c3979c594a3e7db3714ed2e0a","publickey":"b23de44909614c81f567a3c14a223a023c092bed742ae511c031adeb7509e8d8","commentid":"1","receipt":"e5f61b1077ecdc080e9c4f0e9cf1a7ae7925d74e2e4c2670a30cb5292a4a8ddca5b12f7c9a5c973a1bcb97067dcaab41fcaa377d287405e513efc4ff6366b00c","timestamp":1550677397,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
