I would like this to pass on to the voting stage, at least after a few more stakeholders chip in with their views, in order to get a better estimate on both costs and contractors.\n\nConversely, given that the bulk of ATMs are based in the North American continent, an alternative effort could be collaborating with Point of Sale terminal companies which cater to a larger number of geographies, and potentially wider network effects. Both avenues could be considered and are not mutually exclusive. Hence, I would like to hear more opinions from other stakeholders.","signature":"a3ffbbd9956533aa59ddf041f74c6fa87d64cc48ab9e6b48a4a7bbb1d3c5d60d1502da09362c3e435def2b089c0f139af8274c2c3979c594a3e7db3714ed2e0a","publickey":"b23de44909614c81f567a3c14a223a023c092bed742ae511c031adeb7509e8d8","commentid":"1","receipt":"e5f61b1077ecdc080e9c4f0e9cf1a7ae7925d74e2e4c2670a30cb5292a4a8ddca5b12f7c9a5c973a1bcb97067dcaab41fcaa377d287405e513efc4ff6366b00c","timestamp":1550677397,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I remember, for instance, being new to crypto, and buying LTC without knowing anything about it, simply because it appeared on Coinbase. That was a good decision. I don't think you're going to get the full on \"Coinbase effect\" here, but I do think DCR being on a platform with a wide reach raises awareness and credibility, and could lead people to buy a little just to speculate. \n\nI'm not in a position to estimate how much this usage will raise the price of DCR in the long run, but the cost does seem very reasonable considering the amount of work. Also, is this a rare project where we can actually measure ROI? In addition to the harder to quantify \"brand awareness\", can we also track how much DCR is being bought through the ATMs?","signature":"93ffa26fe0752d724acb7d79355c30678bbde26e97c674b0b530ea3824ad0a7628ad44a0b5ed5a42ce21425a75969cd4637df028f5152f57f6dd3b272e5cb50e","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"2","receipt":"b204ead466fd51946210bd192be7579278a87c16252eed4e3171fb50bcb745425cf4d474811ac863c07f55ed685bcf8dba6d82a027a9f45907efb1432bdfb507","timestamp":1550691598,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You do not need any other cryptocurrency for money remittence other than Bitcoin -- the most liquid and wide accepted cryptocurrency.\n\n-General Bytes is a second-tier BTM manufacturer. Genesis Coin is the clear market leader and most professoinal company. We do not want to integrate only with General Bytes.\n\n-99.9% of BTM volume is BTC... there is hardly any volume in LTC, ZEC, XRP or ETH --\u003e no one is going to buy DCR through an Bitcoin ATM.\n\n-BTM operators are not necessarily going to list DCR on their BTMs when it is unclear whether or not it is a security. \n\nThank you for the proposal, but I will be voting against this proposal.","signature":"dbbe496e626247d31f6fb056b84b824ca68b0bfa009ab8837f0f644fdf524d33868b33e4cd713a2b6eb2f7910e32a512a0387f59c34161764bd9e2d81e728b0a","publickey":"d94e4e3478a69860eb90f27576cc51233e8cf04b590dd3d992e5961672694aec","commentid":"7","receipt":"1c951cb63e43b0be7e361715588523f5d14d1a74093961a33e57e2f320a5fbf94d0b377491d68af9224a7c70b3e703db146c35f1e997f4d0cc48265d76d09b06","timestamp":1550714966,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
