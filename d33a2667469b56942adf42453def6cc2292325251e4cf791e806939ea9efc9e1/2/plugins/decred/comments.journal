So this would include: dcrd, dcrwallet, decrediton, dcrdata, politeia.  But would not include: insight, copay due to their obsolescence and dcrandroid/dcrios due to them being still alpha/beta.","signature":"2d76e9f2ef4513d6936a164b061738977d71e5c8542c59183d68102216aaa2295c622e1e2e5bcec72968837f6a4003ea7ef3d2d1ea7f51cf4893601bb116a20d","publickey":"49ea685dac6e302503c7d21a72086028d97a5d4aef04fcd4bbed19618e83d997","commentid":"1","receipt":"dc4f7da46e1f1872aae089c5900f12d2d0581c45d4a3b4e885e6ac98471105d8ea1064d24fab847c50494a0a0bc8889beadbb4d9d65d8455a1ba327079b9fe02","timestamp":1543941707,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
