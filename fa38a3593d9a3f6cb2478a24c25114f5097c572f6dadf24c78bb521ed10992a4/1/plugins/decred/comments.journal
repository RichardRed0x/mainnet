But I also understand the question being raised regarding smaller contributions.\n\nLet's take for example someone who has built a small tool or utility software that doesn't fit in current repos around Decred. This person may be a talented dev and the community may benefit of his work, but he may not necessarily have the time or desire to get a DCC by contributing in other parts of the project before submitting his work.\n\nCould maybe these smaller contributions be an alternate path to obtain the DCC? Or maybe we could have a special repo for smaller and new initiatives where people can submit their already completed work without having the DCC?\n\nRegarding voting fatigue, someone could manage payments in this \"special\" repo each month. Itself becoming the proposal for the sum of the contributions seen as valuable. But we would be back to having a gatekeeper or elected official for this task unless we manage to decentralize the process or have some other way to validate what is considered valuable or not by the community...\n\nAlso, this raise the question of what would happen if someone submit a small proposal for already completed work, for which the community is highly in favor, but the developer behind it has no DCC, and maybe no experience to contribute in existing repos?\n\nI'm mostly thinking out loud here, I'm far from being convinced by any of my own suggestions but I would be interested to hear what you guys think.","signature":"42daafcb483ff14441de77d20a39044741a67eda63b5f8de20a283f264e6f2e9e2961c75f52baa0b1c7ac523f37f948b1341b82e6525fe9c923f828931b13c0b","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"8","receipt":"e98bbc3de535cd7059fc0b0c98562998eab8339751705bac389303e064f1904c37432601151078d5ec4c1056ab840261f2e3d0f9fc943bf575b2947fdd2f8403","timestamp":1539955018,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
