I'm happy to see it has now been made concrete.\n\nOf particular note, I like that it puts an emphasis on one of the general aspects I hope we are able to foster with Pi, which is to give people in their own area of expertise the leeway to do what they do best as opposed to trying to put every little detail up for a vote to be micromanaged by stakeholders, which will absolutely lead to voter exhaustion and apathy.\n\nThe overall approach and conflict resolution mechanism are also very much in the spirit of many systems in Decred, which is about weighting according to various forms of skin in the game, whether that is additional influence in the case of tickets and voting, potential reputational damage in the case of onboarding, or demonstrable hours worked in the case of conflict resolution.","signature":"5f30c85316ff8df4fe1d3e085101d1cc6f85e6dcba4b5431ad99d40cc0d5fc7803d85b62b696f82e1791ec831e918a2eee2510bebdc494e9d224bd4a4b5f980b","publickey":"937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","commentid":"3","receipt":"8b0d105ff4ddf90b6e0066584296c8b36e0a14438ef1b4e2c4a53961ac07eaf22283de31b85dd41e9c2704e3eabc4d21f6e1be8fa75cd4ed666ffa57968ffb0d","timestamp":1539932606,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A process like this will give the contractor community more independence, and I think that is the right way to go.\n\nIt will mean we have to get more formal about identifying domains and who is active in which one.
