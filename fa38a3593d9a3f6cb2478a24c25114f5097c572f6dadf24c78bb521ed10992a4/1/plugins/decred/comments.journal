But I also understand the question being raised regarding smaller contributions.\n\nLet's take for example someone who has built a small tool or utility software that doesn't fit in current repos around Decred. This person may be a talented dev and the community may benefit of his work, but he may not necessarily have the time or desire to get a DCC by contributing in other parts of the project before submitting his work.\n\nCould maybe these smaller contributions be an alternate path to obtain the DCC? Or maybe we could have a special repo for smaller and new initiatives where people can submit their already completed work without having the DCC?\n\nRegarding voting fatigue, someone could manage payments in this \"special\" repo each month.

I can see how this will be an important building block for the DAE. I did not foresee or anticipate this idea.\n\nI am in full support of it, the only question I have is about the number of contractors required to grant or take a DCC. Would it work if we set a more dynamic number, perhaps via percentage of contractors, of a specific subdomain? My worry is only that revoking someone's DCC usually creates controversy so we must be certain that it will be seen as a legitimate action.\n\nYou wrote:\n\n\u003eIt is ideal for these 3 contractors who vouch for an issuance or revocation to not be from the same corporate entity, whenever possible, and, more generically, to be independent of one another. \n\nThis is exactly my worry, that it would be 3 people who are of the same entity. Does \"ideal\" mean it will be just hoped for, as opposed to enforced? Enforcing this would be difficult. \n\nSo my question is, would you be open to the idea of experimenting with a different number or perhaps a percentage, as opposed to a fixed number 3?

I have a couple of concerns/things to think about:\n\n1. This system strikes me as inherently vulnerable to politics \u0026 corruption. I don't think we can engineer that fact away; we're dealing with something that we can't have the stakeholders directly vote on, due to the domain knowledge required. As a result, this particular process is quite similar to representative democracy (and we all know how that tends to work). Just something to keep in mind, and ensure proper checks and balances to compensate.\n\n2. How much should soft skills factor into issuing DCCs? For example, a developer writes good code, but:\n   - Has very poor written English skills, making communication with other developers very difficult. Or:\n   - Is extremely abrasive to co-workers; uses explicit language to refer to other developers and/or their work when things aren't done his way.\n  \n  On one hand, soft skills are important; on the other hand, this could be taken too far. Different people have different views on what is acceptable behavior, and I wouldn't like to see a conflict similar to a US Senate appointment battle over a DCC.\n3. \u003e These votes would be made by individual DCC holders, not the corporate entities they work for.\n  \n  That's a pretty big assumption. If we're designing a system that's supposed to be robust in adversarial circumstances, we should assume that corporate entities will attempt to force their employees to vote a specific way. Either we need a system that can work in such a case, or we need strict rules and clearly defined consequences for corporate entities engaging in such behavior (e.g. revoking the corporation's ability to bill for X amount of time). I would prefer the latter option.\n4. All-contractor votes being weighted by hours billed seems reasonable, but I'm wondering if such a system could be susceptible to a group of contractors that have performed the majority of work in recent history using this power to either operate a cartel ensuring only they are allowed to work on Decred, or enforcing the status quo and not allowing new developers using newer technologies to work on Decred, resulting in technological stagnation.\n  \n  This could possibly be done if the DCC holders cartel tells the stakeholders that the developers being excluded from getting DCCs are writing genuinely bad code. If most of the stakeholders are non-technical, they will likely assume the existing DCC holders are telling the truth, and allow the cartel to go on right under their noses.\n\n  Perhaps I'm just being paranoid here, and I do admit this scenario is probably pretty unlikely, but it's still worth considering all possible cases IMO.","signature":"2ecdad63d57a2370e80e0841eb33222d45e40a5f26868e5d7d724945b5dd211b8b0c9fc2a43399340c7f04603ab91393afe618aa2c2173dd86270158716de000","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"12","receipt":"a1ab1c2c71b39a6c0ec28572347d7a25d82777e2664d6332c929b79905c22591e8fb76be8854b9171ccd9418e140e29e4ef48f794b8dde7506a5988c1166850e","timestamp":1540044035,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A proper way to grant a contracting license and revoke it when needed.\n\n1. As currently written, this system seems to be highly vulnerable to political preferences in getting more work for their own contracting company, conflict of interests or personal grudges.\n\nFor example: 2 Development Contracting companies. Company A has 5 developers and Company B has 1 developer. Company A can agree to revoke companies B DCC to get their work.\n\n**From proposal:**\n\n\u003e It is ideal for these 3 contractors who vouch for an issuance or revocation to not be from the same corporate entity, whenever possible, and, more generically, to be independent of one another. Auditing these DCC issuance and revocation proposals for conflicts-of-interest will be an ongoing task.\n\nIn my opinion, the contractor's company should have 1 vote. For example Company A with 5 members has 1 vote, Contractor Company with 1 member has 1 vote. \n\nIf left as is, some contracting companies will have a monopoly over the entire project or a branch. I don't think it's healthy for the future of the project.\n\n2. Subdomain voting for granting or revoking DCC.\nHaving 3 contractors in a subdomain vouch for the issuance or revocation of a DCC forces those contractors to have skin-in-the-game when it comes to staffing decisions.\n\nFor example, some contractors work and contribute to multiple subdomains: design, social media/marketing, and events. Taking into consideration votes from only 1 subdomain would be not sufficient.\n\n3. Sub-Contractors\nI totally agree on the need of clearing sub-contractors that work for DCC contractors.\n\n4. Stakeholders\nUltimately, some decisions will go to stakeholders for a final approval as we may not be able to resolve by internal voting.\n\nOverall, this is a step in the right direction an I'm looking forward to more comments and ideas.\n\nThank you!","signature":"4e64c39703443268205d0d1bc8a663c2c421fc2a744f4769b95128d6e200b1cdd351849c20f5bc2814f77fd5cec047cccd57a1bfadc5d391985ddf7f73d0ea0c","publickey":"5a452f52d8cf2f66a84689107273f3b3b292307877ba6d92d01bb2dfebeee236","commentid":"13","receipt":"2249502d6846d9019e007816088d91db88bad4e73e12ffdf52ff67c77af9431035bd0294a670e8b4ae07bec81a366896e7547ee1e55dce38620463f769ae220a","timestamp":1540048864,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Bounties are big in crypto generally, and lessons could be learned from projects like Bitcoin.org, or bounty platforms like Bounty0x.\n\n2) \"Mini\" Politeias for each domain, similar to subreddits.
