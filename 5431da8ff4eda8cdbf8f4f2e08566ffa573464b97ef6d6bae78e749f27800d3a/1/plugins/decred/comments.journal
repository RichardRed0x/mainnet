As a result, I think it would be good to understand a more comprehensive value proposition that this may hold for Decred itself?  I agree that the marketing side of things would be a great start, especially if this becomes a popular exchange, but would be keen to understand potential other benefits to Decred as a project, and as a community.\n\n\n2. **Confidence in obtaining credible and capable contractors**\nHow confident are you that there are available contractors that will be able to do this work, within budget, whilst adhering to the high quality that the Decred community is used to?\n\n\n3. **Projected Cost**\nThe projected cost of this project currently specifies quite a wide range. What would the difference be (from a delivery, quality, features, and time-line perspective) between the lower end and the upper end?\n\nThank again for raising this proposal and looking forward to some further clarification.","signature":"a11fcdcbc4809c8d8bb9b95ffe3eb6b87b032b3d69d3bc90f032c5dd7535e889904ab8e0fff97edb36295ff4e4a4b9c478319199d596ce8c3b690aaa214b0602","publickey":"71836a3819239ee5fc24dfd0369e4bb9ea1d0cf3cfc49d5207cb448827b6a2fc","commentid":"1","receipt":"0a6688be390fbcc3b2feb326fa726247aad5a7b533c96779a37613c24672998b60a1b4910853bfb540e175a317df5134b22621deda6f5db08ef106b2d31c520d","timestamp":1549300318,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
