As a result, I think it would be good to understand a more comprehensive value proposition that this may hold for Decred itself?  I agree that the marketing side of things would be a great start, especially if this becomes a popular exchange, but would be keen to understand potential other benefits to Decred as a project, and as a community.\n\n\n2. **Confidence in obtaining credible and capable contractors**\nHow confident are you that there are available contractors that will be able to do this work, within budget, whilst adhering to the high quality that the Decred community is used to?\n\n\n3. **Projected Cost**\nThe projected cost of this project currently specifies quite a wide range. What would the difference be (from a delivery, quality, features, and time-line perspective) between the lower end and the upper end?\n\nThank again for raising this proposal and looking forward to some further clarification.","signature":"a11fcdcbc4809c8d8bb9b95ffe3eb6b87b032b3d69d3bc90f032c5dd7535e889904ab8e0fff97edb36295ff4e4a4b9c478319199d596ce8c3b690aaa214b0602","publickey":"71836a3819239ee5fc24dfd0369e4bb9ea1d0cf3cfc49d5207cb448827b6a2fc","commentid":"1","receipt":"0a6688be390fbcc3b2feb326fa726247aad5a7b533c96779a37613c24672998b60a1b4910853bfb540e175a317df5134b22621deda6f5db08ef106b2d31c520d","timestamp":1549300318,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

At the high end, this is approximately 10% of the current DAO treasury holdings, or about 3% of the entire treasury subsidy that will ever exist. [treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx)\n\n### -**DEX Landscape is crowded**\nThe DEX landscape is crowded. There is the Binance DEX, Blocknet, OpenLedger, IDEX, CryptoBridge, Bisq, Bancor DEX, Kyber, 0x, etc... I know a lot of these are semi-centralized, take a fat commission, require shit-tokens, are still WIP, etc... so don't get on my ass about it. My point is that the landscape is already crowded and is getting more crowded. \n\n### -**Concerns about lot size order matching**\nThis one is a bit complicated so bear with me. Essentially to avoid all the shady games that go on with centralized exchanges, the idea is to use lot sizes when matching orders. IE, say I put up 30 DCR for 0.006 BTC each, but someone only wants 20 DCR for 0.006 each, my 30 DCR would need to be subdivided into smaller lots to make the trade happen.\n\nThe issue here is twofold: price discovery is limited by the granularity of lot size, and on-chain fees could eat up smaller trades.\n\n**Price Discovery \u0026 Granularity**\nThe resolution of price discovery is limited by both the order size and the minimum lot size. Smaller lot sizes and larger order sizes both increase the resolution of price discovery. IE, for price resolution of +/- 1% of a given exchange rate, you'd need at least one of the assets to have lot sizes of 1/100th of the order being placed (_well, either that, or accept that trades would occur at specific \"harmonics\" where the relative lot sizes of each asset matched the desired exchange rate_). This means that price discovery would degrade at lower value transactions, and leads to my 2nd point:\n\n**On-Chain Fees**\nIf we do need end up needing transactions to be made up of many small lots to allow price discovery to occur, consider that all transactions will be on-chain. Especially for smaller transactions, this could eat up a significant % of the total transaction value, possibly enough to make the fees or commission on other exchanges seem more attractive in comparison. Especially if we return to conditions where Bitcoin (and possibly Decred) fees are considered expensive.\n\n_TLDR_; I think it's a noble idea but I'm concerned it will be an expensive, low-volume, niche market for high-value transactions.\n\nAnyway, that's my 2 cents. Curious to see what others think.","signature":"5e011eea3df9e82c4b40e8a0dc76ac6a04ebe0172d038b5794e532402f0981019a5e3de7a10b7b6771ef16f5d5f70ca4c797246343eab35668808b5e4aa3e706","publickey":"561e590b88343c5ccb54b700ac686484cc392e656c66d1823842d2cbb37c0327","commentid":"3","receipt":"67bd0767f8816f61dfe6fd83e55f7560925d9d0b13772fac94af1d88e7d6d18a3b4b50f1b212c4ffcb72e50af47c11ed2579040202ddde73e5409ce54bb0470f","timestamp":1549330338,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
