As a result, I think it would be good to understand a more comprehensive value proposition that this may hold for Decred itself?  I agree that the marketing side of things would be a great start, especially if this becomes a popular exchange, but would be keen to understand potential other benefits to Decred as a project, and as a community.\n\n\n2. **Confidence in obtaining credible and capable contractors**\nHow confident are you that there are available contractors that will be able to do this work, within budget, whilst adhering to the high quality that the Decred community is used to?\n\n\n3. **Projected Cost**\nThe projected cost of this project currently specifies quite a wide range. What would the difference be (from a delivery, quality, features, and time-line perspective) between the lower end and the upper end?\n\nThank again for raising this proposal and looking forward to some further clarification.","signature":"a11fcdcbc4809c8d8bb9b95ffe3eb6b87b032b3d69d3bc90f032c5dd7535e889904ab8e0fff97edb36295ff4e4a4b9c478319199d596ce8c3b690aaa214b0602","publickey":"71836a3819239ee5fc24dfd0369e4bb9ea1d0cf3cfc49d5207cb448827b6a2fc","commentid":"1","receipt":"0a6688be390fbcc3b2feb326fa726247aad5a7b533c96779a37613c24672998b60a1b4910853bfb540e175a317df5134b22621deda6f5db08ef106b2d31c520d","timestamp":1549300318,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

At the high end, this is approximately 10% of the current DAO treasury holdings, or about 3% of the entire treasury subsidy that will ever exist. [treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx)\n\n### -**DEX Landscape is crowded**\nThe DEX landscape is crowded. There is the Binance DEX, Blocknet, OpenLedger, IDEX, CryptoBridge, Bisq, Bancor DEX, Kyber, 0x, etc... I know a lot of these are semi-centralized, take a fat commission, require shit-tokens, are still WIP, etc... so don't get on my ass about it. My point is that the landscape is already crowded and is getting more crowded. \n\n### -**Concerns about lot size order matching**\nThis one is a bit complicated so bear with me. Essentially to avoid all the shady games that go on with centralized exchanges, the idea is to use lot sizes when matching orders. IE, say I put up 30 DCR for 0.006 BTC each, but someone only wants 20 DCR for 0.006 each, my 30 DCR would need to be subdivided into smaller lots to make the trade happen.\n\nThe issue here is twofold: price discovery is limited by the granularity of lot size, and on-chain fees could eat up smaller trades.\n\n**Price Discovery \u0026 Granularity**\nThe resolution of price discovery is limited by both the order size and the minimum lot size. Smaller lot sizes and larger order sizes both increase the resolution of price discovery. IE, for price resolution of +/- 1% of a given exchange rate, you'd need at least one of the assets to have lot sizes of 1/100th of the order being placed (_well, either that, or accept that trades would occur at specific \"harmonics\" where the relative lot sizes of each asset matched the desired exchange rate_). This means that price discovery would degrade at lower value transactions, and leads to my 2nd point:\n\n**On-Chain Fees**\nIf we do need end up needing transactions to be made up of many small lots to allow price discovery to occur, consider that all transactions will be on-chain. Especially for smaller transactions, this could eat up a significant % of the total transaction value, possibly enough to make the fees or commission on other exchanges seem more attractive in comparison. Especially if we return to conditions where Bitcoin (and possibly Decred) fees are considered expensive.\n\n_TLDR_; I think it's a noble idea but I'm concerned it will be an expensive, low-volume, niche market for high-value transactions.\n\nAnyway, that's my 2 cents. Curious to see what others think.","signature":"5e011eea3df9e82c4b40e8a0dc76ac6a04ebe0172d038b5794e532402f0981019a5e3de7a10b7b6771ef16f5d5f70ca4c797246343eab35668808b5e4aa3e706","publickey":"561e590b88343c5ccb54b700ac686484cc392e656c66d1823842d2cbb37c0327","commentid":"3","receipt":"67bd0767f8816f61dfe6fd83e55f7560925d9d0b13772fac94af1d88e7d6d18a3b4b50f1b212c4ffcb72e50af47c11ed2579040202ddde73e5409ce54bb0470f","timestamp":1549330338,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Rather, I discuss whether the Decred treasury should pay for its development.\n\n---\n\nFirst off, to put things into perspective, the high-end ask for this proposal is $1M USD.\n\n- At the current DCR/USD exchange rate of $15.75, that is 63,492 DCR. \n- Given the current treasury balance of 605,900 DCR, this expenditure would deplete 10.47% of the treasury.\n- Assuming the current treasury block reward of 1.87804688, it would take 33,807 blocks, or 117 days - around 4 months (assuming 5mins/block), to \"pay off\" this amount. This does not take into account the fact that the block reward decreases over time, or the occasional block that doesn't include all 5 ticket votes (cutting that block reward), so the actual time period would be longer.\n\nAll these statistics assume that the market price stays the same (which it won't, though I won't speculate which direction it's heading). Given these figures, it's clear that this is a significant outlay of funds, and therefore deserves careful thought and scrutiny.\n\n---\n\nIMHO, the treasury funds should only be spent for two purposes:\n\n- Funding the ongoing maintenance of Decred software, etc. to ensure that DCR does not loose its market value.\n- Funding projects that will increase the market value of DCR, rewarding the stakeholders.\n\nClearly, this proposal does not fit in the former purpose; we shall discuss whether it fits within the latter.\n\nI believe my view on the purpose of the treasury is consistent with sentiments that have been expressed on other proposals, especially [this highly-upvoted comment on the recent Baeond proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f545b359fcf1b40b356e9cb556cb422cc7ff01b628b577f804cdc45ce414f5dd/comments/14). Quoting an excerpt from there:\n\n\u003e The treasury is not a venture capital fund, politeia isn't a platform to allocate grants. And stakeholders are not a group of investors looking to spend money on random cool ideas (even if they are really cool).\n\u003e \n\u003e The treasury is a precious and fragile insurance policy. It's the energy source to keep Decred evolving, growing staying secure, implementing required changes, and staying relevant in the future ahead.\n\nAn exchange/DEX (however cool it may be), is not directly related to Decred (other than supporting it as an asset). I fail to see how this project will benefit Decred (or have a benefit of sufficient magnitude to justify the cost).\n\n---\n\nThe proposal states:\n\n\u003e This improved exchange infrastructure will benefit Decred directly, by making the exchange process more permissionless, thereby increasing its accessibility.\n\nHow will this make buying Decred more accessible? Today, I can go to https://changenow.io/ and swap BTC for DCR without creating an account, without KYC/AML (in most cases), and have my DCR within 20 minutes. This is just one example, I am sure there are other instant swap providers with similar offerings.\n\nThis exchange promises only to support crypto-to-crypto swaps. Potential DCR buyers already have a far bigger hurdle to overcome, and that is turning fiat into BTC. For many people, that is accomplished via signing up to a centralized exchange, often doing KYC. For some, that exchange is an exchange like https://bittrex.com/ that supports DCR, allowing them to convert USD to DCR (albeit via two trades).\n\nI am aware of the fact that the proposed DEX uses atomic swaps, but I fail to see how removing the requirement of trusting an instant exchange will make Decred so much more accessible that it will increase the price of DCR in a meaningful way (much less compensate the cost of the project).\n\nThe proposal further states:\n\n\u003e However, it will also benefit the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem as a piece of common infrastructure, which we can use as a marketing tool.\n\nWhile I agree that such a DEX will be a marketing tool, again, I question whether its effectiveness there will be enough to defray the cost building it.\n\nThe treasury is not a VC firm or grant fund. Just because the DEX is open-source doesn't mean we should just throw grant money at it. The idea itself may be sound, but the Decred treasury isn't the place to fund such an idea IMO.","signature":"52c1f11785480904c19d66d9c28b7cfde25498aa5796bfe976dda2b924932e3da5c23c5a2f954a750c5dd27cb621165b65516cc151751865ce692d1a59fdad00","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"4","receipt":"c11e76ae8b122ce968031b2d61c7b6b75659c74c41f1d55285cdc3a7fad96613f28a363dbea8579f4c78df3757fab6a4c9e213c9184d498e17894a0ef1710f08","timestamp":1549380623,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This would greatly limit the rate at which orders can be placed by fast bots and mitigate the vast majority of known \"dark\" trading patterns.  \n\n\u003e Any plans to actively engage other chains to integrate?\n\nThis process has already begun in our [atomicswap repo on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/), where other projects have added support for doing atomic swaps on their corresponding chains.\n\n\u003e Any plans for protocols that don't leave a trace of swap on the chains?\n\nThe first step is always making it work.  Once it is working, obfuscating the swaps on the corresponding chains can happen.

First, I consider ryanzim to provide generally good constructive criticism, which I will address below.  Second, ryanzim is a developer for the Exodus wallet, which, as far as I am aware, collects fees on exchanges performed in their wallet and is their project's primary source of income.  This presents, IMO, a pretty clear conflict-of-interest regarding the view he has shared on the proposal.\n\nI agree that the upper end cost cited for the work is high at USD 1M, and it was not intended to indicate that would be _likely_ cost of the work, merely that we should not entertain proposals to build it for any amount greater than that.\n\nRegarding the relevance of the proposal, I would argue that it is very much relevant to Decred.  Several notable DCR holders have brought up that they consider our lack of liquidity to be a problem that needs fixing.  The conventional solution to this problem is to pay a market maker (\"MM\") to make your project's market on one or more exchanges, and this typically costs USD 30K / mo or more and gives the MM an enormous amount of control over the market price of your asset.  One of the reasons that MMs cost so much is that they are typically experienced proprietary traders who have to deal with the risks and stresses of a wide variety of bots being run against them.  If the MM gets cleaned out by someone else's bots, they have no reason to continue making the market and will quit.  If we build a system that uses pseudorandom order matching, this substantially reduces the threat of being gamed by others' bots, which lowers the risks and stresses associated with being a MM.  Lowering the barriers to being a MM will lead to a deeper order book and help decentralize our liquidity, versus paying one or a few MMs to perform this task for us.\n\nComparing a custodial \"instant\" exchange to a DEX that uses atomic swaps is comparing apples and oranges.  ChangeNOW is certainly an interesting service, but it is permissioned - per their FAQ \"ChangeNOW’s AML/KYC procedure is supported by an automated risk prevention system. If a transaction is marked suspicious by this system, the exchange is put on hold and the customer in question is then asked to confirm their identity.\"  Note that instant exchanges do nothing to solve the problem of order book depth that we have, which creates slippage for people entering and exiting DCR positions.\n\nI am disappointed to see you characterize this proposal as VC-like.  If we take a moment to look at the big picture with cryptocurrencies, it goes something like this:\n\n* The irresponsible behavior of banks cued SN to create/release Bitcoin, which decentralized value storage and transmission via gamification of the timestamping process.\n* The central planning committee of Bitcoin Core / Blockstream cued me to work with tacotime and _ingsoc to create and release Decred, which decentralized sovereignty via gamification of the decision-making process.\n\nMy motivation to create Decred was based on experiencing the bullshit of Bitcoin's central planning committee firsthand, and I had the luxury of tacotime having proposed a system that could address precisely this problem concurrent with my experiences.  After 3 years of building out Decred, it has become clear to me that a major hurdle for the project is that of market liquidity.  This proposal is a reflection of my seeing this centralization and gatekeeping of liquidity as being the next major problem for a cryptocurrency-based ecosystem to resolve, i.e.\n\n* The centralization of liquidity within the CC ecosystem cued me to propose decentralized exchange via \"ungamification\" of the trading process.","signature":"4fd94edecbf973ea3f2779d8d770075894c8c18b88bc6fbb73c0a5db3d33f65fdecfbca0a7595afc39dae47bad6026c46c57ab5eaedbe36699b5867bed15c405","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"15","receipt":"fdea538af785ae79c8afd33ed0d957013e892d8d1d9c0eae782267e474546aaf34c02a8acf3dee9f0d79a8af718ccfc6fce809be095959a43dd475848d28620e","timestamp":1549477522,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I am of the view that most of these projects have the wrong incentive structure, i.e. collecting fees on trades, which is a pretty fundamental difference between what is being proposed here and what already exists.  When you're collecting fees on trades, you're incentivized to generate volume, not order book depth, which is what I believe we all really want.\n\nYour issues with lot sizes are valid, but the reality of working with on-chain transactions as the basis for unfalsifiable orders acts as a strong constraint on what we can do.  The partial fill problem is tricky.  I would expect there to be several lot sizes being traded concurrently in a healthy DEX-based market, which would mean there would be several pairs traded, each at a pair of chosen lot sizes.  In more detail, we could have DCR/BTC markets that have (DCR 10, BTC 0.01), (DCR 1, BTC 0.001), and (DCR 0.1, BTC 0.0001) lot sizes, where episodic arbitrage occurs between them.\n\nOnce fee pressure becomes an issue with the lot sizes, I would expect some of the exchange to move off-chain and occur over LN, per my blog entry comments.","signature":"ab612b1ebaf427e743368faa386a6515f9c290ce100d068e384da9a0ddc5729687622f2cf277ced0f1791bc14b3364cadb83b8003f6523f69aa6bb74477c8b0e","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"16","receipt":"6b409fc70af042857ae7f5da1813286ae5066bfd47f4ea3799bf5816daad9f32f564c00a95e683b7e34c87316d8313fa05965911cb90cbf37d4a970bae693b0b","timestamp":1549478594,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Instead, I have solely focused on the issue of whether the Decred treasury should pay for the DEX, since I feel there is less potential for conflict-of-interest there.\n\nAlso, for the record, all my opinions here are my own personal opinions, not those of my employer, and I am receiving no compensation for expressing my opinions here. Hopefully that goes without saying, but I thought I'd make it explicitly clear.\n\n---\n\n\u003e I agree that the upper end cost cited for the work is high at USD 1M, and it was not intended to indicate that would be likely cost of the work, merely that we should not entertain proposals to build it for any amount greater than that.\n\nUnderstood, thanks for clarifying. Regardless, I believe my point still stands that this is a significant outlay of funds, and needs careful consideration.\n\n---\n\nRegarding your two paragraphs about liquidity/MMs/instant exchanges:\n\nIt seems I somewhat misunderstood your main intention behind the exchange; I was arguing under the assumption that by \"increasing accessibility\", you meant \"making it easier for new people (either noobs to crypto, or people already in crypto, but new to DCR) to buy their first DCR\". Reading your reply here, it seems I've misunderstood.\n\nIf I'm understanding you correctly, your primary motivation for building the exchange is:\n\n1. There isn't enough Decred liquidity\n1. You don't want to pay a MM to increase liquidity\n1. Instead, you want to build a DEX that will want to make people be MMs for DCR without direct pay\n1. You believe this will also have a side effect of decentralizing market-making\n1.  ChangeNOW does nothing to solve your primary gripe with the current situation: liquidity\n\nPlease correct me if I've misunderstood you yet again.\n\n---\n\n\u003e I am disappointed to see you characterize this proposal as VC-like\n\nVC-like probably isn't the right term to use. I don't mean that your exchange proposal is some ridiculous get-rich-quick scheme; I don't mean that the proposal fundamentally misunderstands what crypto is all about, like too many VC firms do; etc.\n\nLet me try to clarify my position on what I feel should and should not receive treasury funding. Examples are probably best to illustrate my point.\n\nThings the treasury is for funding:\n\n- Maintaining Decred software\n- Building a mobile wallet for Decred\n- Building Politeia\n- Building a DAE to manage the treasury funds\n- Building libraries to make it easier for other products to implement Decred\n- Funding marketing for Decred\n\nThings the treasury could possibly fund (debatable):\n\n- Integration into an existing ATM network\n- Integration fees for a hardware wallet\n\nThings out of scope for treasury funding (in my OP, I incorrectly used the term VC-like to refer to these kinds of things):\n\n- Building an all-new hardware wallet\n- Building a new crypto ATM machine that supports Decred\n- Building an exchange (centralized or decentralized)\n\nIn short, this exchange may or may not become popular. If it becomes popular, it may or may not help Decred liquidity (i.e. maybe it'll just be the most popular way to exchange BTC/LTC). We have no way of knowing for sure.\n\nI fail to see how building a better exchange is any more deserving of funding from the treasury, than building a better hardware wallet or ATM machine. Does the world need better hardware wallets, ATM machines, or exchanges? Maybe, maybe not; but I don't believe the treasury needs to fund any of these projects.","signature":"af38dc951b3e0c187d4086b2e2cce91a48465cd6fd4871d31bc5bd182cf5092590c6524fa5872c8dd2a87d0737e717c61baaa350831498c1371954956d6d5904","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"18","receipt":"9238d82c525e918921fec0752d0b33707e77e630d20c79c2de5aed2682cf76698d39874fee69a6a5d5849a97d589242dae925168cbbed6ac8f24c4fdf501c905","timestamp":1549481752,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

What if the price of Decred continues to drop?  Despite what some people believe, the treasury will run dry someday.  The amount of Decred being proposed for the dex will fund a decade or more of critical development needs years from now.\n\nIn my opinion the actual resources expended will be closer to the upper limit of the cost and time estimates.  I’m basing this on the historical performance of milestone forecasting on this project.\n\nAt this time I would vote no on a 100% DCR funded dex.  I would be open to partnering with other projects on this effort or deferring the effort to a later date when the project market cap has improved.\n\nMy view on the dex is based on how I perceive its value to Decred. I have no doubt the engineering concept is sound and could be successfully executed under the direction of C0.","signature":"3e93a09bad81270e7d9df65c314239849d8e58939605748ac29f0fc02b65277f9f1d97b3736ad1a19186c7797a3b127c768360a8e2964eb4d5868584d7917f0f","publickey":"dbc137c9276d6f5a3dcc3422406d15cb07b3036f57308a3c6bca90648e3577ab","commentid":"19","receipt":"b496e9bdd90a23c31b5bd93bc3bd0c39149e5f03c146e56d6a1e514bbb16ce65a3e0fee75c8793e5bfbadf342a8625520cbfc33736f1b962ec757448b1115507","timestamp":1549509600,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

After some specified time period, or when there are deemed to be enough proposals that have finished their discussion phase, voting on all of the Dex proposals would happen simultaneously. Voting would be conducted on the understanding that only the proposal with the top score (Yes - No votes) would be approved - and that this proposal must satisfy the usual approval criteria. This would allow voters to vote Yes on each proposal they deemed suitable, without the prospect of accidentally approving more than one.\n\nThere are a variety of ways the next stage could be conducted. I'm not advocating for this specific approach, but would be opposed to a next stage that allowed a winner to be approved without demonstrating 60% approval among stakeholders.","signature":"a4c1c649f4f0776f6ae152e91d30739a114f4f8739f21d6d7260645483f703c8247ede4d26f866bd80b555d87f82c9919440355553a16d685aecb9fe13f11907","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"23","receipt":"b5e99ae9019014b6594aafc6ae62c65615732031d36fed4cb41df500606b3409bc1318a711cd772f025dd368913a773a78b27a0d64077e1f9510f96d3b42c407","timestamp":1549561930,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

My objection is on a few fronts simultaneously, although none of them relate to the technical implementation details - not because I don't have reservations, but because the other objections supersede them anyway. So, in no particular order:\n\n1. There is little guarantee that the exchange will gain traction and aid Decred in any meaningful way.  \n   1. Numerous similar projects with great teams have tried and failed to gain liquidity (even centralised exchanges with large budgets).  \n   2. I'm unsure if a DEX is what the vast majority of people that will bring liquidity want; most people I know, whilst they grumble at KYC, are quite happy with Binance, Kraken, Bitstamp, etc.  \n   3. It is possible that even if the DEX attracted liquidity for some crosses (such as ETH/BTC, or BCH/BTC), it still might not attract liquidity for DCR.\n2. This would benefit all cryptocurrencies listed on the DEX so the cost to develop should be split, not fully funded by Decred.\n3. One of the justifications for this proposal is that it will increase liquidity, but as objection #1 states it's quite a risky bet. There is a much more measurable method to increase liquidity (and thus indirectly increase market cap): designated market making (DMM) (https://sci-hub.tw/10.1017/S0022109000004166). Of course I am biased, but I don't agree with the objections given to using a DMM (and the empirical evidence backs me up):\n\u003e The conventional solution to this problem is to pay a market maker (\"MM\") to make your project's market on one or more exchanges, and this typically costs USD 30K / mo or more and gives the MM an enormous amount of control over the market price of your asset.  \n\n$30,000 seems a lot at first, but when you realise that empirically DMM's add 5+% to your market cap, that means it'd be worth about $7m to Decred as a whole and ~$12.5k/month of additional funds to the treasury alone. For further info on valuing liquidity and market makers, the introduction of this paper provides a good meta analysis of the research already available: https://sci-hub.tw/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2154699. I further argue the price manipulation standpoint. Using a DMM increases market depth and would actually make DCR less susceptible to market manipulation. That said, there are a lot of valid concerns regarding choosing a DMM which you have raised on Slack. There are many unscrupulous crypto DMMs out there (even some very well known ones). You have to really know what you're doing when it comes to the contract negotiation (namely, spread guarantees, uptime, and sizes shown at various levels).","signature":"82f197a914dd8bab17c341ea8a6e5d2de2d53efc04b0e63163c15163f663281b8f5c28cce729a1e8a48919f85ffdee2b0f5027720d78b3863316e173130ca005","publickey":"58e6c6676b5b75f00ece826b63e185f961c3acb49319806d9f103f920190a556","commentid":"24","receipt":"95c05c8dcf47b28908824ce6296c88b0c24539f3e54d21d9ac472d2ec265f71b9607fd7ec34a5fead0d6aed0db34c6083171a1931ea5fab9044dabf269167200","timestamp":1549563033,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

IMO this is a complicated matter because the points you present are valid. However they remain valid only when the objective is to maintain and foster the current ecosystem, with the same actors and incentives. \n\nPersonally, I can't stand KYC, trading fees, and trusting tiers. I have years of bad experiences with exchanges, banks,  financial and/or CC services who are built with the only goal of artificially extracting more money from you.\n\nThe reason I got in cryptocurrencies is because I want out of this. I see every effort made to re-create the same structures and incentives as ways to hold back evolution and change.\n\nAt some point we will need a real DEX if we have any hope of changing these structures. And not the closed source, intermediary token, fee grabbing attempts we see now.\n\nFor me a real DEX would not be operated by a single party, would not require a single wallet and would be open source and possible to integrate freely in any wallet or app for any CC without requiring a central entity or fees and there would be no actors for regulators to potentially mess with and hinder functionality in the future. Unfortunately I have absolutely no confidence in any of the existing \"DEX\" projects out there to achieve this...\n\n\nOn the question of whether the Decred stakeholders should use the treasury to fund this project, we'll see how the vote turns out. The things I'm considering now are :\n\n- We are in a unique position in this space that we have the ability to build a \"real\" DEX. If we don't, who \u0026 when does someone will?\n- For how long can we go without a real DEX before it become a real issue for innovation? Or do we just accept past and current structures as inevitable?\n- There's risk in using a sizeable part of our treasury.\n- We are in a bear market and the effective cost would be higher now.\n- In a bull market it would be cheaper but don't we wish there was a \"real\" DEX when the time comes.\n\n\nThis one really isn't easy for stakeholders. ;)\n\nI will probably vote to go ahead with the RFP, and keep an extremely close eye on budgets and details before considering the next step...","signature":"6ce12ec0b6500f992e8b65954fbf9c652615874386d74b7bc4afa644a4e607cff6bf13255162086fdfd7da966c1ae3a074036033149f470f34abc4978d144600","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"27","receipt":"07873716a0f35d8554f2cf300ab03fdba93a62921028dd134d39c1dc42cb87a36eba0634e401fce1f90b8beb78830c1d7ddab46fef161d23e550ea22e84c130f","timestamp":1549606051,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If I ever were to advocate for Decred to get a DMM, it would simply be to give the argument for it, list all the DMMs in the space that I'm aware of, and facilitate an open discussion comparing them all. I spoke about it here because an argument for doing a DEX was to add liquidity whilst expressly rejecting DMMs as an easy and cheaper approach to achieve the same end. Whilst there is a lot of merit for condemning DMMs, the points used in the argument were, in my opinion, not valid (namely, that it costs a lot, is somehow fake liquidity, and will increase market manipulation). I cited sources backing up that refutation because I'm intimately familiar with DMM and had them to hand.","signature":"1719dcb0c0314e5730495009672e3c3585890214af851d3013c8d4552d6c60ef5e47e057c0145624f30e6b9790ec4510e6dddd08efbbffc41a454b17eecb150f","publickey":"58e6c6676b5b75f00ece826b63e185f961c3acb49319806d9f103f920190a556","commentid":"29","receipt":"413c0da867db176d12bc7654ef2550484340cfb8e21d834c60e729dfa23e79de64446a3ac7b2a8e7ae829f4f40ec1b0401d9946be9dfee16d87c7912de1ac809","timestamp":1549614936,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
