2019 Events Funding
**What?**

In the past, Decred has sponsored, exhibited, and attended various events across the world. In doing so, it likely spent on the order of 400K USD in 2018. 

After soliciting and receiving large amounts of input from Ditto, #Marketing in Matrix, and on Reddit, I propose funding for an event plan for the remainder of 2019 that will:

1.  Maintain a presence in North America and Europe

1. Expand Decred into Asia

1.  Enable approved spokespersons to present relevant topics at high level conferences across the world throughout the year

**Why?**

There are two components of why, both of which I'll address.

First, I make this proposal in order to put sovereignty on this issue in the hands of the stakeholders, and to move the project further towards a decentralized autonomous entity. I believe that over time, all expenditures must come from some budget approved by the stakeholders. The aim of this proposal is to gain stakeholder approval for a budget and outline a construct that gives stakeholders input and sovereignty, and also provides autonomy for the contirbutors doing the work.

Second, although Decred's purchasing power is less than it was last year, as is event attendance, there is still value in maintaining a smaller event presence:

1.  It sends a signal that Decred is still active and strong

1. Increases awareness of Decred in new and existing geographies

1. Leverages Dittoâ€™s work to yield further media coverage

1. As other projects die off or avoid events, it allows Decred to stand out and elicit a second look from the ecosystem to explain why Decred is a community-directed digital currency designed to be a superior store of value for generations to come

1. It generates content for social media and an opportunity for us to promote software releases or other news

1. It enables community members to get together, ideate, and build rapport

The last bullet point may seem soft, but from the NABTC last month, Decred was able to vet multiple new contractors, inspire a community member to launch *Decred in Depth*, a podcast that will soon be proposed in Politeia, and another contributor to launch the Decred Aggregator in Telegram and dedicate a monthly article in investinblockchain.com to Decred. Bringing people together from time to time offers real benefits.

**How?**

I propose two types of event attendance:

1. Events where Decred would exhibit/speak


2. Quality conferences where Decred would like to submit for and win speaking spots on merit. This would bring Decred contributors to a wider set of conferences and position the project as experts on such things as consensus systems, governance, a new way to organize the workplace, and so on.

For the first type, I propose we exhibit at one, large, crypto-focused event in each of Europe, Asia, and the Americas throughout the remainder of 2019. I considered including explicit events here, but arrangements have not yet been finalized (without stakeholder approval) and I'd prefer we not cede negotiating power. Examples of this type of event include [Consensus](https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2019), [MoneyConf](https://moneyconf.com/), and [Token2049](https://www.token2049.com/). The Asian conference is planned for later in the year in order to yield local operations time to build communities to staff and attend.

Side note: Many of these events are not planned more than 4-6 months out, so we lack full visibility into possible events through the remainder of the year.

**Budget for the three events will be 50K USD per event, or 150K total. **This budgeting is based upon historical precedent that includes the cost of sponsorship, travel expenses, and contractor hours.

For the second part, I present a list of vetted conferences with dates, location, and suggested topics. Approved speakers (explained in the who section) will have the opportunity to apply for speaking spots at these conferences and know they are funded for travel and time. 

It is preferred, but not necessary, that proposals be shared with Dustorf and the Events room in advance. Dustorf and Ditto have experience drafting proposals of this sort and are eager to help improve Decred's chances of winning speaking slots. 

Notes: Intercontinental travel would require special dispensation/approval due to the cost of flights. New events of similar quality can be added to this list, as well as topics as they become relevant to Decred.

**The proposed budget for speakers is 50K USD.**

**Who?**


Final decisions on large conference attendance will be decided by Dustorf with input from a wide range of the community. The Decred team for each conference will be comprised as much as possible of local community members and preference shall be given to those whose travel costs are lower. Decisions shall be made on final roster by Dustorf in the Events room with input from the community.


For speaking opportunities, community members should be well known within the community and speak on topics relevant to Decred in a way that positions Decred as a thought leader in the crypto space. Speakers should have experience addressing crowds and doing interviews, and should review Ditto's media training deck prior to the event. A sample list of topics and speakers is below.

**When?**


**This plan is designed to fund events for the remainder of 2019 with 200K USD **broken into two buckets. If the budget is exhausted, then a new proposal would need to be introduced to fund further events. If the budget is not used, funds remain in the Treasury and Decred frugality prevails.
