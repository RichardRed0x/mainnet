Without such spaces where outsiders can follow and understand decision-making, there is a significant barrier between those on the inside making the decisions, and those on the outside. In that case the best that insiders can hope to do is to accurately interpret the needs of the other stakeholders and act in a way they think is fair.\n\nIn my view building a successful cryptocurrency movement requires acquainting many more people with the fundamentals the technology. Only on this basis can people act as effective guardians of the networks. The best way to achieve this is with a role people can productively play, and incentives!\n\nDecred's approach is excellent in this regard:\n\n- Granting stakeholders a quantifiable say in decision-making that cuts across every aspect of the project through both the on-chain consensus voting and Politeia proposals\n- Incentivising participation with voting rewards, for ticket voters.\n- Incentivising participation with treasury funds, for contributors who work on the project and generate value for the project and space\n\nAny project that wants to be resistant to social attacks should be pursuing the same kinds of aims. I think it would be very worthwhile to track where all of this activity is happening in the space and start developing a better collective view on what is going on.\n\nFor projects where it is not possible to identify such open public spaces, and where \"the team\" are effectively walled off from the community by handlers - that would probably signify more of a centralized/hierarchical/corporate production model. \n\nI have been thinking about how to build a resource like this, and I hope to put together a prototype for what that could look like in the not too distant future. I think the whole space could benefit from a clear overview of the attributes of each project, the tradeoffs being made, and links to key venues or sources.\n\nI see the social media analysis suggested here as a starting point, the data is quite easily accessible and standardized between projects, so makes for an easy entry-point to understanding some aspects of the  communities and how they organize (or don't).","signature":"0d707cf6a8f805f4b0ee6b7f1e28eba325de7d8b96a6af6fc23f0741b766e300b63bd81acfd0a8861afaf1a6aa855a4dcae65bc7e3f311652b0d530cdbe3be08","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"3","receipt":"ab6aee356bc9d9579348bc914e2a727df0dc76db0816b12f531f7a01621f06d027625f803e2948cc0ac7df442f87d81a4969b6e902f806f03af972893bab9106","timestamp":1543272531,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Let's assume this research project is completed, and we know how to improve Decred's social media presence. \nIf the new approach is consistent with Ditto's approach, the research would not provide much value. If it is not consistent with Ditto's approach, why do we hire Ditto if we know there are better ways to market Decred.\n\nThere are two research topics I have been thinking for a while, and I don't have an answer. I hope there are other people interested in similar topics.\n\n1) DCR's current market cap is $180 million. How do we arrive at this valuation? Is it because of DCR's governance model? Is it because half of the circulation is locked by POS?\n2) What are the use cases for Decred? Why do we need Decred and how Decred can be used in 3 years. I know this is up to the stakeholders, but it would be great if research can be done to show us the options.","signature":"41f12b3df4fd40d264870c542f1adeebbd14a657bff5c02aea8d0b74cf6309701daafab6b422abd2369d3fc651d392a41014e702019f958ce128886dd5df5d0f","publickey":"2ab21c9a6a138ff055181eccd82999b83a034299eaa21f8fd55d9e5232a4f3d3","commentid":"8","receipt":"2d8714c605c5925f08a0b8b10e32faa53e0e40834f6ecf210929db68a3af927f86a9ff0b62e6b1cf59831b6ba90f829cc6b07020095204a09b8ef41245b0db04","timestamp":1543369358,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Examples include [Jake at MIT](https://events.technologyreview.com/video/watch/jake-yocom-piatt-decred-blockchain-sovereignty/) giving a straight forward presentation, the fascinating ideas during the [Politeia Challenge](https://medium.com/@slgoss04/decreds-politeia-challenge-took-place-february-10th-at-the-hyatt-regency-in-austin-texas-482986b75a18) and even the classic [Politeia Use Cases EP4 of Decred Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQYmLx0eTg) which aired over a year ago now.\n\nWe are using Politeia and dcrtime and it works great.  The success should be viewed like the Mars landing.  This is a very big deal and frankly other projects are missing out by not utilizing these tools and the practically free blockchain anchoring and pre-built authorization abilities in Politeia.\n\nA lot of other things are also going right.  A quick search of what good [readme files](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) should look like on open source projects or a deep dive into the code in the [politeia code](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui) illustrates we have solid repositories and excellent code commenting.\n\nIs the extended community interested in looking at how to better support the development team that has built these tools in advocating for their usage?  If so, are we interested in researching some basic questions?  Here are a few examples that could be looked at:\n\n1. What are projects today doing as best practice to attract usage?\n2. What do business integration companies working with other products today want that has not been built out (specifications? documentation? technical briefs? media/materials?)?\n3. Approximately how much effort would be required to build any of the examples shared in presentations (certification authorization, poa, etc...) and what are requirements (skills, assets, services)?","signature":"44a1bc733242fe0e897a82cc473720834f64aa3176125c3a34d963fb545d09dcf2d022a5774412979e63b9711639ad18b913fe4f9697aebf1da2b47d1a4ff500","publickey":"6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","commentid":"9","receipt":"ba2110b57a17750854f75247d7fc627ce82099f290bc561afeb1d91622828fa744c5e869a0764f88ca4a6033a4c692feeb50532576d13b3dafee1fbc4a66b807","timestamp":1543390301,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Research that helps us to understand this would be worthwhile.\n\nThe example questions are interesting, but without proposed methodologies it is difficult to evaluate whether they are the best questions to ask.\n\nFor this subject, I think I would want to hear from _potential users_ of dcrtime/politeia about whether they are interested in the features that this software offers. \n\nWho are these _potential users_? Well, I think that's something we should consider first in some depth. Who do we think could benefit from dcrtime? What kind of uses would we like to promote?\n\nIf we know who the potential users are, we could come up with a methodology that involves reaching out to those groups in some way, making them aware of dcrtime and what it can do - and _then_ asking our questions about whether they're interested and what the likely impediments would be. \n\nWith this kind of approach the work could serve outreach and research purposes at the same time.","signature":"b14884851e61bf3c1d096b4e3b368b4b6b7d13e37c8f566b4544f0a000aba1a3d33ae0e9a55eaa1b284a6df299b137b4a1ce4bf52a672313ad64be03c2a45800","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"12","receipt":"fe64bbc89cdbc3d87c53a179b64b015407ecffffeee5f616bc045f34ababd6638c2a73000662a18877a6d8987eb362b47b285a034ef96e957f4ca9e08d233608","timestamp":1543508974,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I don't think it is possible to assess how well a project is governed without observing that governance in action. If you can't point to the locations where a project's governance takes place, participation is probably not open and permissionless.","signature":"fbdd3590a311af9a68133f0f38a2ad2fabdbec144c63b60bda286dd8402542aa8f76d43b2c16b26d64c493f05b0f5618dbace19e8b0e2ae18b9be725a5a6e808","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"16","receipt":"6a76100017cbfdd2b596ef8d520c29ff6a56efc5d2dbe503c7fe5b19361b380a166201ad0bf51d17d749007ba20aff03eeec2fa0fe15b39fcc7eaaf9b9de240d","timestamp":1543535164,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

That's a good focus but I think it would make sense to also incorporate gathering information about some other aspects of the various blockchains/cryptocurrencies. For example security model would be a good thing to cover in the same resource. \n\nAlso, when doing a deep dive on a particular project it usually makes sense to look into how it works pretty broadly, rather than focusing only on governance. If we can come up with good ways to formalize that knowledge I think it could be very useful.","signature":"aeffc6627cde47bf4d57d70eacc85334e4e145e586db72965a7a6bc66eaaa3be5cc094dcfb666f26ed49725005d081a9e22c7e2e19a235de883fdf6384d1910b","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"17","receipt":"9b753e8c0e5230fcc82f7ab6a009bde311aac8f30c141987b537475c7b4e8138ea15ce37cd965281d71ebb9c63e18fe0ba885fbea3eb83b03bd094b9a5e36a03","timestamp":1543535546,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
