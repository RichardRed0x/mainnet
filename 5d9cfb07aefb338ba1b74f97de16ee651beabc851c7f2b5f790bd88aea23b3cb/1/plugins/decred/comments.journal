I would be interested in seeing network analysis of who follows/likes/re-tweets who, and what the components of the network look like.\n- GitHub - not exactly social media but has some of the same features and is quite amenable to detailed analysis. @degeri is already [working on](https://github.com/degeri/decred_contributor_track) a way to identify first-time Decred contributors automatically through GitHub for the Journal.\n\nThe purpose would be addressing questions like:\n\n- How do different projects use the same platform? What kind of value do they gain from the platform? Is there anything Decred can learn from their approach?\n- Is it possible to identify attempts at manipulating or gaming the platform? \n\nI have created a [repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/analysis/) with exploratory work on reddit, it would probably make sense to start new repositories for research on other platforms.","signature":"09b889982f4cbf826f89e68f0d761c6a8004ba1cfe57491690656e5de295b0b42307321faadd0dcebf343ba105089913b3fe4279a92e7f5c0c73960a93937d03","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"378f778b75c96a64089b72331313242e25dd156a1f7680abb1dd017143fcb8e5abe49590410f182ef9906af4980ae7d97e12d7728d8cc98a6974b45fb2f53d0f","timestamp":1543271615,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Without such spaces where outsiders can follow and understand decision-making, there is a significant barrier between those on the inside making the decisions, and those on the outside. In that case the best that insiders can hope to do is to accurately interpret the needs of the other stakeholders and act in a way they think is fair.\n\nIn my view building a successful cryptocurrency movement requires acquainting many more people with the fundamentals the technology. Only on this basis can people act as effective guardians of the networks. The best way to achieve this is with a role people can productively play, and incentives!\n\nDecred's approach is excellent in this regard:\n\n- Granting stakeholders a quantifiable say in decision-making that cuts across every aspect of the project through both the on-chain consensus voting and Politeia proposals\n- Incentivising participation with voting rewards, for ticket voters.\n- Incentivising participation with treasury funds, for contributors who work on the project and generate value for the project and space\n\nAny project that wants to be resistant to social attacks should be pursuing the same kinds of aims. I think it would be very worthwhile to track where all of this activity is happening in the space and start developing a better collective view on what is going on.\n\nFor projects where it is not possible to identify such open public spaces, and where \"the team\" are effectively walled off from the community by handlers - that would probably signify more of a centralized/hierarchical/corporate production model. \n\nI have been thinking about how to build a resource like this, and I hope to put together a prototype for what that could look like in the not too distant future. I think the whole space could benefit from a clear overview of the attributes of each project, the tradeoffs being made, and links to key venues or sources.\n\nI see the social media analysis suggested here as a starting point, the data is quite easily accessible and standardized between projects, so makes for an easy entry-point to understanding some aspects of the  communities and how they organize (or don't).","signature":"0d707cf6a8f805f4b0ee6b7f1e28eba325de7d8b96a6af6fc23f0741b766e300b63bd81acfd0a8861afaf1a6aa855a4dcae65bc7e3f311652b0d530cdbe3be08","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"3","receipt":"ab6aee356bc9d9579348bc914e2a727df0dc76db0816b12f531f7a01621f06d027625f803e2948cc0ac7df442f87d81a4969b6e902f806f03af972893bab9106","timestamp":1543272531,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
