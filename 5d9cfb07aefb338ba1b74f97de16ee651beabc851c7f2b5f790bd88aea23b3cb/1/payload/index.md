Decred Open Source Research proposal 2 - research projects
The purpose of this proposal is to collect and discuss ideas for research projects that this program should fund - as described in the edit to the [first research proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd).

The reason for using a Pi proposal is to take advantage of the system's document certification and anti-sockpuppet features. 

Up/down votes on comments are stored transparently in the Pi repository and will soon be easily associated with user IDs. They can be relied upon to the same degree as individuals signalling agreement with text or "reactions" in the bridged communications channels, maybe more so because this signalling mechanism is available to everyone and robustly recorded. 

The plan for this proposal is that it remains open for some time, displaying a list of the open research projects being worked on and linking to their respective repositories. 

**Please only submit research questions or projects as top-level comments.**

For these top-level comments the **upvote** and **downvote** buttons should be used to signal that you **agree** or **disagree** that the specific project/question is worth pursuing. Essentially, upvote top-level comments that represent lines of research you would be happy for the treasury to fund.

Feel free to reply to the top-level comments with questions, criticisms, or follow-on ideas.

As this is an experimental use of Pi I'm not going to commit to doing anything in particular based on the voting scores, but I will give thorough consideration to any project with a good score.

To be considered an approved project and listed below, it will be necessary to show some exploration work or minimal proof of concept that gives a sense of how the project would run. 

I will be submitting some comments with project ideas and associated repositories, these should serve as examples of what I consider to be a reasonable starting point.

That's not to say that people should only submit fully formed project ideas. It's fine to submit a question or idea and see if anyone is interested to help develop it into a viable project. Hopefully this process will be about improving research plans/projects, not just approving or rejecting them.

If you are interested in working on this program or just following the discussion, join the #research channel on Slack or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!vGasNHFXqjoEWUBTIi:decred.org)

### Currently open research projects:

*I will start adding projects here after a few days, anything with a score of **5** or higher will be considered, this threshold is subject to change depending on voting rates.*
