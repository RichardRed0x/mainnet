Decred Radio Advertising, 190+ FM and AM Stations, + Intl. Satellite
Hello!  I’m Ian Freeman, one of the hosts of [Free Talk Live](http://freetalklive.com/).  Free Talk Live (FTL) is a seven-day-a-week, live, nationally syndicated libertarian, pro-crypto radio program on more than [190 AM and FM radio stations](http://affiliates.freetalklive.com/) across the US - see the attached map image for locations of our stations or [click here](http://radio.freetalklive.com). You may have heard us recently [interviewing Marco Peereboom](https://soundcloud.com/freetalklive/free-talk-live-2018-10-27#t=40:50) of Decred at the Texas Bitcoin Conference.  If you missed that, [you can listen to it here](https://soundcloud.com/freetalklive/free-talk-live-2018-10-27#t=40:50).  

Free Talk Live was the first consumer media in the world to discuss Bitcoin, in 2010, and Charlie Shrem said **"Bitcoin wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for you guys!"** Hyperbolic as that might be, it strongly hints at the power of FTL and these radio stations. These are real FCC licensed radio stations! You can see where they are on [our radio transmitter map](http://radio.freetalklive.com/).  (This Summer we added 50,000 Watt WRKO in Boston - stations don’t get any bigger than that.)  Our show is heard on both conservative AND progressive talk stations - we’re the only national issues-based show that is heard on both formats.

However, our reach is not exclusive to radio stations.  We also have more than 15 million downloads on our podcast and others listen to us via live streaming and our international satellite channels (more on that later).  We’ve been around the cryptocurrency world since 2011 and FTL is credited by Gavin Andresen and Roger Ver as helping to give Bitcoin the initial boost it needed to get widespread adoption. 

**"Many of the earliest Bitcoin adopters first learned about it through Free Talk Live...I'm convinced that is one of the sparks that turned a crazy little open source software project into a multi-billion dollar industry."**  -Gavin Andresen, Original Bitcoin Head Developer 

**"By broadcasting this message since 2011...FTL has been instrumental in creating the widespread adoption that we have today."**  -Roger Ver, CEO Bitcoin.com

We don’t need Decred to build us a fancy studio or to help us start doing anything.  We already have a studio and we’ve been doing our show since 2002 and have been in national syndication since 2004.  We’re established in the industry and are the longest-running show in our daypart (7-10pm Eastern) in national syndication. We’ve outlasted all of our competition. In case you doubt our claims of success, TALKERS Magazine (the premiere industry publication for talk radio) this year named us the #27 most important talk radio show as part of their “Heavy Hundred”!  It’s our tenth year on the chart, and we’ve been moving up every year. [See it for yourself here](http://www.talkers.com/2018-talkers-heavy-hundred-26-50/).  I've also attached this year's Heavy Hundred graphic here to this post.

As early adopters of Bitcoin, we’ve done very well and are comfortable enough to be very choosy about which advertisers we accept.

This proposal is to bring Decred on as a prime sponsor of Free Talk Live.  Per show, this means Decred receives three (3) :30 second recorded radio ads, one :30 podcast ad and one (1) live promotion per show.  For the recorded ads, we’ll use different voices.  This, we feel, helps function as a sort of “Word of Mouth” campaign. Listeners hear the same message repeated by many different people.

Any comments you have are welcome. We are putting this in for 3 months of funding, but I must advise you that branding advertising is a long term endeavor.  

I mentioned earlier that Free Talk Live is heard on [international satellite channels](http://sat.lrn.fm/).  I've attached the coverage maps here.  It’s called Free-to-Air satellite broadcasting and it’s popular globally, especially in poorer countries.  Poor people can’t afford to pay for satellite channels, so Free-to-Air is not encrypted, which means the channels cost nothing to receive. We’ve been on satellite since 2010 over North and Central America (Galaxy 19) and over Sub-Saharan Africa (SES-5) since 2012.  We know we’re reaching people, as we’ve heard from listeners in African nations like Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Kenya, and Nigeria.  [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV7zwG_J1yA) (from our satellite fundraiser on Patreon) that explains what we’re doing in more detail and introduces you to our listener Ako in Cameroon:

The satellite channel we’re on is [LRN.FM - The Liberty Radio Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV7zwG_J1yA).  It’s a 24/7 internet-based streaming audio network that’s been in existence since 2009 and I am its program director.

This is important branding reaching people in their cars, homes, and on their headphones. Thank you for reading this far and for your vote.
