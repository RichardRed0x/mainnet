They have become a powerful advertising monopoly and all sectors are impacted by that.\n\nI appreciate that FTL talked about bitcoin early.  That is different to me than paying them to talk about us.  Gavin may have expressed appreciation about FTL getting the word out about Bitcoin early on...but that is very different than Bitcoin sponsoring FTL early on.\n\nIf we choose to sponsor FTL we would in some eyes be financially supporting a political stance/ethos.  Regardless of the alignment with the community (and I'm guessing there is at least some) that will have an impact.  One possibility if there is high alignment (and I don't really know if there is or not) is a \"echo chamber syndrome\" we see in controlled feeds today where we attract people who think like the majority of the community and thus we grow only in that small subset of political thinking even though the technology is fundamentally useful and attractive to the larger whole (what is libertarian now...10% of Americans (and based on my brief investigation I believe that the show is basically \"American Libertarian\" which is different than most forms of libertarianism globally: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism))\n\nPerhaps our PR firm Ditto can help us navigate how to most ethically spend ad money and if this would fit into a pragmatic campaign.","signature":"9e36184a7c2c7bb8d2cabd6935e6b0c4db972720d140ff87e0b39ec4942fe3f044be131fcffc89f3ffa486146eac5eb61f150a5b3a2a32df602943b44a012a01","publickey":"6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","commentid":"2","receipt":"9b01e78bd072a36846a96821fd3bb846d7a0b648783f593e1ffae63161ecd7bdd12615ee3aaa97cd5778f3af2651cfd4c8e80ff11038f7e5b73f89a14897fa03","timestamp":1543445379,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
