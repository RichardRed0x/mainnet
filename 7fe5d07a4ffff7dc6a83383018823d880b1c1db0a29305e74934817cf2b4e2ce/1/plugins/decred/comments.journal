So Bitcoin was a sponsor of FTL early on. We also got lots of sponsor dollars from all of the BTC startups back in the day. \n\nYes, you do need to be concerned with being pigeon-holed as \"libertarian money\", but that is kinda how Bitcoin did it. The Internet is full of articles warning that the libertarians have made their own money and it is dangerous. Also, Decred, needs to build it's community as well as getting exposure.

I have worked in the ad industry for 20 years, and on FTL for 16. I want to clear up a few things. \n\nFirst, thank you for your feedback! I would rather have someone think about my ad package, decide against it and tell me why than just to sit here wondering why they didn't vote yes. So, thanks. \n\nSecond, Roger Ver, paid us to advertise Bitcoin since 2011 or 2012. So Bitcoin was a sponsor of FTL early on. We also got lots of sponsor dollars from all of the BTC startups back in the day. \n\nYes, you do need to be concerned with being pigeon-holed as \"libertarian money\", but that is kinda how Bitcoin did it. The Internet is full of articles warning that the libertarians have made their own money and it is dangerous. Also, Decred, needs to build it's community as well as getting exposure.

Yes, we have worked with Bitcoin.com, HoriZen (ZenCash), Monero, and Dash. On top of that, we have worked with MANY crypto businesses and crypto accepting businesses. We got in early and are considered to be a market maker in that segment. \n\n2. No telling. Advertising is an art, not a science. We are audio. We don't have click-through rates. This is the biggest problem with audio ads: they are hard to track. Also, I imagine these as branding ads, not direct response. Branding ads are intended to create a reputation and keep your product top of mind. Can you think of a jingle for a product from your youth? If you can, branding was successful. \n\nI can guarantee that your ads will be heard on 190+ US radio stations, 2 satellite channels, dozens of streams, get 100,000+/monthly podcast downloads resulting millions of listening sessions per month, but I can't give you any kind of results, other than many advertisers stay with us month after month. \n\n3. The show is heard on many platforms. The biggest are radio and podcast. Neilson rates radio listening and that is how we get our estimates. General numbers are available on the Internet, but we don't pay the $30k per year for the use of the more specific numbers. I can give you screenshots of our podcast downloads \n\n4. We are A LOT less expensive than any other Top 30 radio program that I have ever seen. Like 1/10th as much. Like I said in the presentation, we did well and don't have to take advertisers that we don't want, and we don't have much of a sales department either. So, our rates are low, but we are making enough to keep broadcasting. So, things are fine. \n\nI just did a quick google search on underwriting costs for NPR. It looks like you can get a nice web-banner on their site (No on air presence at all) for the cost of this package. I don't know if that 20 grand would get you a banner for a month or a year. https://www.nationalpublicmedia.com/get-started/\n\nFTL is the best value in advertising, especially if you want to hit males in the US. \n\n4. Ditto is a PR firm. Usually PR firms attempt to get you interviews, they don't place ads, generally. That is the job of an ad agency. I have lots of critiques of ad agencies, after 20 years in this business. We can talk about that too, if you want. :-)\n\nThanks again!","signature":"bdfda8cfbbaa13d225f39a213f490fc1526a2bb8fce060598930783b802364669b09be27a928e3dbbd35609794442e65fa0ec6c3087a989beac8e8371d82d108","publickey":"eaea5a521038bb31a938dd44e0c8af91116ba502a86626aa006ebbb5fa8551d3","commentid":"10","receipt":"9f5e902b313d14b5761c343f974a5c64d990e62ba490ef59b6e589ad2d6c845d6dff37f4329b086d9cc77bcfbfd5db311330e9e00cd171d4090efe5ae7357303","timestamp":1543596489,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There are 2 main ways to listen to the show: the live version and the recorded version. The Live promotions are at least :60 seconds in length, and are part of the show, as opposed to a recorded ad. So, they are heard on both versions of the show. The :30 podcast ads are heard in the recorded version only. The :30 second radio ads are heard in the live version. If you wonder “Why not have the ads that air in the live version just air in the recorded one too?” The answer is that podcast audiences have a much lower tolerance for ads than do live listeners. \n\nObviously, these numbers are estimates. Because of the way that radio listeners are quantified (they are counted by the 15-minute listening segment, not by the 3-hour radio program) we can claim millions of listens per month. That isn’t a perfect way to count, but neither is by the listener. A listener could be a person that listens to the whole show on podcast, on the treadmill at the gym or it could be a mom in the car for 10 minutes with screaming kids. The short answer to your question is about 250,000 weekly listeners. We don’t count daily because different days of the week have different audience size.","signature":"d627dd9da5ee54ead25b952177f7a307f4d06d37fd6490c825acecc83cc79a93399bd0af5f14d038d16d81a79cbe50af134e7d66e89873be2221dbb53da2d406","publickey":"b719b0bee46a2fb08a1d31f5b81577f886c1d51707da860645757ea28cc19e03","commentid":"25","receipt":"751a2d8b132eef73cdbfef079434b3a3818db5afcc451af86f703b6f8dbee7d8b086bc9530f90904ca3744e61c89a1ad725827c3ca85f30852bc846f8ca76103","timestamp":1543960135,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Yes, we had a DASH proposal. We advertised them for close to 2 years and then they began focusing on Venezuela and we parted ways. The DASH proposal expires this month, but it went live months ago and they are not currently on the air with us.  I was clear in my responses here that DASH HAD been an advertiser. That is what we do, we are a radio program and we sell ads. DASH’s slot is available and we offered it to y’all. There have been some months that we get 85% of our revenue from crypto. We are a show that is friendly to crypto. \n\nYes, the price is different from the previous DASH proposal because pricing for crypto has gone down recently. If it goes down after this proposal is approved, we still will provide the ads that we offered at the price we promised. \n\nYes, we modified this proposal from our DASH proposal. Why is that bad? It is a good proposal that lays out our Major Sponsor proposal quite well. You can find our packages here: https://www.freetalklive.com/advertise. \n\nIf a car salesman sells 2 different people the same make/model and color of car, I don’t think anyone would call it a scandal. \n\nRegarding Smartcash: That IS NOT an active proposal. It was just me seeing what they would have to say. I wanted to see what would happen here first, but again, is there a problem with us having 2 up-and-coming cryptos as advertisers? Should I include an exclusivity option here?

What is Dittos' opinion on this and would this be something they stand behind at this current time?\n\nHere is what Liz Bagot (Ditto AVP) posted in Slack regarding this proposal: \n\n\u003e The question was put to Ditto in the marketing channel, and I wanted to post it here as well. We've been asked to weigh in on the radio proposal in Politeia, and here's what we think:\n\n\u003e Generally, we recommend an integrated approach in which we know the message, who we want to say it to, and where those people are. Maybe it’s radio, maybe it’s not. If you’re going for broad awareness, it may make sense down the line to go for a broader radio play. However, we think paid advertising is premature at this stage — we have yet to work through Decred’s branding and messaging, which we need to nail down and make airtight before we approach the broader public. For the sake of putting on a solid public front, we need to agree on how best to tell the Decred story and position ourselves, both internally and externally. This is the first order of business for Decred’s work with Ditto — and what we’ll be discussing with a couple Decred folks this Thursday. We recommend focusing on getting the free earned media stuff first (which Ditto has already started). Once we’ve established a strong external narrative, we can consider how and if paid opportunities might complement our efforts.\n\nSo with this feedback, I am willing to vote no for now, but wouldn't be opposed to this proposal in the next few months once Ditto has done their work and we are ready to spread our message to the masses.  \n\nThanks again for taking the time to reach out with this proposal!","signature":"5a5158265fbbca335c9cefc2a038399ab911c79cc9f225680d7b12532f289db05589bad59a53423941d7ef83787b377d6168521479d4784870789f5e7f872608","publickey":"89a8f131b0fae3858fce15fe7dfd9161062c9aa8b560f3445bc028847fa577e1","commentid":"35","receipt":"7d005d10444a5d041776f84a2baf4221d106bfbbcaf90e7dcb9625cd01ec5c17746e7bcba8130dab579deae8a569cd7d8f842fc53e1c421ff19d645cfc70ab08","timestamp":1544063930,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Implementing this proposal in the current form is against what I perceive as Decred ethos. But I do like your contributions to cryptocurrency, your audience and your network. Full length shows and interviews, or even commentary, would be great to broadcast.\n\nLong version below.\n\nI very like concept, but not the format:\n\n\u003e Per show, this means Decred receives three (3) :30 second recorded radio ads, one :30 podcast ad and one (1) live promotion per show. For the recorded ads, we’ll use different voices. This, we feel, helps function as a sort of “Word of Mouth” campaign. Listeners hear the same message repeated by many different people.\n\nThis is my biggest concern for this proposal. 30 second ads sound like cheap shilling. What deep, thoughtful information can one squeeze in 30 seconds? I don't want to see \"Decred ads\" or even \"promotion\". I'd love to see full time shows and interviews that explain why Decred is so amazing, e.g. \"Decred is one of the few places where you can have real sovereignty\". I don't want sovereignty to be packaged into a product that can be sold in 30 seconds. Using different voices for 30 second ads makes it even worse, it sounds like mind manipulation. You can't fake a \"word of mouth\", and if you can, I don't want it that way. Sorry this sounds harsh, but when reading first time it raised my eyebrows so I wanted to share what I feel.\n\nI'm also not sure about the banners because I hate all ads that interrupt my thoughts, and always filter them.\n\nThat said, I do like the concept of using radio in general. I cannot verify all claims, but if they are true I am thankful and respectful for doing a big contribution to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency movement.\n\nWhat would be great instead is to have full length shows and interviews with our community members because they understand and can explain Decred well. There are a lot of topics to cover like sovereignty, skin in the game, conflicts of interest, aligned incentives, forks, ASIC resistance, misconceptions about PoW energy usage, ICOs, Politeia's resistance to manupulation and more. News from Decred space would be great too, we have [quite a lot](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) going on! Another approach is commentary on what happens in the space.\n\nThe only short \"ads\" I would tolerate is announcements of the shows so more people don't miss it, e.g. inserting \"By the way tomorrow at X we will have Y tell us Decred's approach to Z\" at the end of a block about Z.\n\n@oregonisaac raised a good point that sponsoring the whole radio can be interpreted by the public as sponsoring certain political stance/ethos. We shall be really careful about our messaging, and it is impossible to audit everything that happens on the radio. One way to address this is to pay only for the shows and not sponsor the whole radio.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n* General concept of using radio.\n* Past contribution to Decred - show with Marco. I haven't listened to it, but the sole fact of its existence is nice.\n* Past contribution to cryptocurrency space.\n* Libertarian audience sounds like it aligns with Decred. I'm not 100% sure as I don't know them. I hope they are not zealots - we need people who think for themselves.\n* The price looks reasonable for the network of your size.\n* Appreciate how you engaged in comments.\n\nNotes:\n\n* \":30 second\" reads a bit confusing, just \"30 second\" would do.\n\nIf this proposal is voted No, a reworked iteration can be posted later and I would suggest to focus it on non-ad content.","signature":"370da2f315e6746c4f1dc69d3a4cf635143ce09ab04b5b5ee61aec033e56f58d3f72351ff89cf17d24b3932f1fccea938b306b3d324b6122474616b3a8eb2006","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"41","receipt":"46e416699d2ee3b2aecdcbf5d7b361e4f404f6e9177cd17f8b085ab1a639bfac13927fad3dc5d31f1bea92d5149972ed3e0a2dda76d8830ddaae298094589205","timestamp":1544079623,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It is a good idea, but your suggestions on implementation very likely won’t work. You want to change the format of a very successful, 16 year old, radio program, #27 in the nation with millions of monthly listens, to fit your preferences. Sure, everyone wants to do that. We have a dog vitamin supplement company that has advertised with us for years. I would bet, if asked, they would love us to talk all about dog health and stuff. The reality is that if we did such a thing, it would destroy listenership. I can't make the Decred Show, I can't even make the Crypto Show. It won't fly, or at least I don't believe that it would fly on the radio on weekdays. What you are talking about is a podcast, not a radio program. If someone makes the Decred podcast. I will happily advise my listeners to go take a listen. It is a fine idea, but this implementation of it just won't work. If you wanted to talk about total sponsorship of FTL, where Decred commits for the year at the price of 30 grand per month, we can definitely talk about that. \n\nI would further ad that this is the package that we sold Roger Ver to promote Bitcoin, back in 2011 or 2012, and Gavin Andresen, Roger Ver and Charlie shrem credit us with giving Bitcoin that initial boost that made it the phenom that it is today.","signature":"929e4355374160a71f31dc8bc6a8f50ffb4a5c9be013bc861871807323d2f66cb0b4b00f3e943a06fe69e1c735dd3a4bae0204ff668da77a29e4c753984c250a","publickey":"f4902815caf342eaf8f1ca12826d49bedad71d36eebc7cff73616c696da9e09a","commentid":"42","receipt":"87adcfd25f076a93381665aaa26dceea1623ed591315fb1f67e8d1bff096541cf15e7aa7ce14d77ba43056382df8cdab14b50fda8da67e46e9867c5847dc2b04","timestamp":1544109734,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If you want to see the price of the Major Sponsorship package, it is available for all to see at advertise.freetalklive.com. \n\nWe consider the DASH proposal dead, did not re-enter it last month and since it isn't going to pass, It strongly mitigates your point.","signature":"3b31276dd687938c15fd9710640eca50e7aef8c60dc0db3d772fcaabaf11e8a138b3f3b42ab91fdd30f03df55ce52a61079efad90a56b8531ff80cdd1001ae0a","publickey":"f4902815caf342eaf8f1ca12826d49bedad71d36eebc7cff73616c696da9e09a","commentid":"43","receipt":"4d2be706cbba6fa26066900496190682027a66de3865d1f31a5bcda9535e12898a2763cee04d31b84009361843ddb3939ff4d358830f4e8da1a43fcc0cb68d0d","timestamp":1544109849,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Awesome thank you. Look, if we need to resubmit later, that is fine, we will be here. We have been on the air for 16 years and talking about crypto since 2010. \n\nBut can you ask Ditto some things for me? \n1. Is Ditto an Ad Agency or a PR firm, or some kind of hybrid?\n2. How many ad campaigns have they placed for crypto companies and what was the longest time frame that one of those schedules ran on a single venue?\n3. What is their branding philosophy?  Do they believe in sticking with one media and creating a relationship with the audience or a haphazard media mix?\n4. Will they be producing a radio ad themselves? Do they have a studio? What mics do they use? \n5. Will they be taking a 15% cut of the ad buy or are they going to pay a net rate. \n\nI don't want to sound confrontational, but I just deal with PR firms all of the time and they are great for placing interviews but they rarely have anything to do with ad buys. I am sure they have input if asked but there is a difference between an ad agency and a PR firm.","signature":"d10bb2bee17683d4a9ff6fe31afeb921383a3b079cb961d5badc46c2656fe55ffb5b1e54d36abb35394d510065428dc15503119478dd1fcdb5104ef810785a02","publickey":"f4902815caf342eaf8f1ca12826d49bedad71d36eebc7cff73616c696da9e09a","commentid":"45","receipt":"97ce1e3c429e1c5e42ffa8a21685e2a4638e6865ebfe7b5092177bcbe3718ed3015a04503033860e2ca727526ddc80c6d45e4e830c206c89656cbf7f4ab00604","timestamp":1544110562,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
