So Bitcoin was a sponsor of FTL early on. We also got lots of sponsor dollars from all of the BTC startups back in the day. \n\nYes, you do need to be concerned with being pigeon-holed as \"libertarian money\", but that is kinda how Bitcoin did it. The Internet is full of articles warning that the libertarians have made their own money and it is dangerous. Also, Decred, needs to build it's community as well as getting exposure. FTL can help with both. libertarians are passionate and intelligent. They are a great pool from which to draw activists for Decred. As Ian said, besides our core of libertarian listeners, we have hundreds of thousands of ordinary folks that switch on their car radios every month that hear us for the first time, or very casually.

I have worked in the ad industry for 20 years, and on FTL for 16. I want to clear up a few things. \n\nFirst, thank you for your feedback! I would rather have someone think about my ad package, decide against it and tell me why than just to sit here wondering why they didn't vote yes. So, thanks. \n\nSecond, Roger Ver, paid us to advertise Bitcoin since 2011 or 2012. So Bitcoin was a sponsor of FTL early on. We also got lots of sponsor dollars from all of the BTC startups back in the day. \n\nYes, you do need to be concerned with being pigeon-holed as \"libertarian money\", but that is kinda how Bitcoin did it. The Internet is full of articles warning that the libertarians have made their own money and it is dangerous. Also, Decred, needs to build it's community as well as getting exposure.

Yes, we have worked with Bitcoin.com, HoriZen (ZenCash), Monero, and Dash. On top of that, we have worked with MANY crypto businesses and crypto accepting businesses. We got in early and are considered to be a market maker in that segment. \n\n2. No telling. Advertising is an art, not a science. We are audio. We don't have click-through rates. This is the biggest problem with audio ads: they are hard to track. Also, I imagine these as branding ads, not direct response. Branding ads are intended to create a reputation and keep your product top of mind. Can you think of a jingle for a product from your youth? If you can, branding was successful. \n\nI can guarantee that your ads will be heard on 190+ US radio stations, 2 satellite channels, dozens of streams, get 100,000+/monthly podcast downloads resulting millions of listening sessions per month, but I can't give you any kind of results, other than many advertisers stay with us month after month. \n\n3. The show is heard on many platforms. The biggest are radio and podcast. Neilson rates radio listening and that is how we get our estimates. General numbers are available on the Internet, but we don't pay the $30k per year for the use of the more specific numbers. I can give you screenshots of our podcast downloads \n\n4. We are A LOT less expensive than any other Top 30 radio program that I have ever seen. Like 1/10th as much. Like I said in the presentation, we did well and don't have to take advertisers that we don't want, and we don't have much of a sales department either. So, our rates are low, but we are making enough to keep broadcasting. So, things are fine. \n\nI just did a quick google search on underwriting costs for NPR. It looks like you can get a nice web-banner on their site (No on air presence at all) for the cost of this package. I don't know if that 20 grand would get you a banner for a month or a year. https://www.nationalpublicmedia.com/get-started/\n\nFTL is the best value in advertising, especially if you want to hit males in the US. \n\n4. Ditto is a PR firm. Usually PR firms attempt to get you interviews, they don't place ads, generally. That is the job of an ad agency. I have lots of critiques of ad agencies, after 20 years in this business. We can talk about that too, if you want. :-)\n\nThanks again!","signature":"bdfda8cfbbaa13d225f39a213f490fc1526a2bb8fce060598930783b802364669b09be27a928e3dbbd35609794442e65fa0ec6c3087a989beac8e8371d82d108","publickey":"eaea5a521038bb31a938dd44e0c8af91116ba502a86626aa006ebbb5fa8551d3","commentid":"10","receipt":"9f5e902b313d14b5761c343f974a5c64d990e62ba490ef59b6e589ad2d6c845d6dff37f4329b086d9cc77bcfbfd5db311330e9e00cd171d4090efe5ae7357303","timestamp":1543596489,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There are 2 main ways to listen to the show: the live version and the recorded version. The Live promotions are at least :60 seconds in length, and are part of the show, as opposed to a recorded ad. So, they are heard on both versions of the show. The :30 podcast ads are heard in the recorded version only. The :30 second radio ads are heard in the live version. If you wonder “Why not have the ads that air in the live version just air in the recorded one too?” The answer is that podcast audiences have a much lower tolerance for ads than do live listeners. \n\nObviously, these numbers are estimates. Because of the way that radio listeners are quantified (they are counted by the 15-minute listening segment, not by the 3-hour radio program) we can claim millions of listens per month. That isn’t a perfect way to count, but neither is by the listener. A listener could be a person that listens to the whole show on podcast, on the treadmill at the gym or it could be a mom in the car for 10 minutes with screaming kids. The short answer to your question is about 250,000 weekly listeners. We don’t count daily because different days of the week have different audience size.","signature":"d627dd9da5ee54ead25b952177f7a307f4d06d37fd6490c825acecc83cc79a93399bd0af5f14d038d16d81a79cbe50af134e7d66e89873be2221dbb53da2d406","publickey":"b719b0bee46a2fb08a1d31f5b81577f886c1d51707da860645757ea28cc19e03","commentid":"25","receipt":"751a2d8b132eef73cdbfef079434b3a3818db5afcc451af86f703b6f8dbee7d8b086bc9530f90904ca3744e61c89a1ad725827c3ca85f30852bc846f8ca76103","timestamp":1543960135,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
