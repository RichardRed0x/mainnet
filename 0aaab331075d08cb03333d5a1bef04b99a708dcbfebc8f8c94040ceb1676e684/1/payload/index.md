Upgrade mining algorithm to ProgPoW
**TLDR: Increase decentralization and drive new community adoption by changing the mining algorithm to ProgPoW.**


ProgPoW is an algorithm that is purpose built by hardware engineers to exercise all parts of the silicon on a graphics card. Ethereum is planning on changing their algorithm to ProgPoW in the next hard fork (March time frame). 


It is a fact that there are more people with GPUs in their household than ASICs. Changing to ProgPoW allows the coins to get distributed more fairly and evenly in the world. It also reduces the risk of attack from large Chinese ASIC farms gathering the majority of the coins. More people will join or rally behind Decred if they can easily mine the coin at home.


Don't take my word for it, please do your own research. It would be a great move for Decred and the rest of the industry would take notice!

Lets bring new blood into the decred community and increase decentralization in the process!
