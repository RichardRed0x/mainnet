It is a complete and total waste of stakeholder's time as written, because it does not contain any of the technical details necessary to make it work with Decred, budgetary requirements, deployment considerations, a discussion of the myriad negative consequences of such a change to balance the perceived benefits, a discussion of compatibility characteristics, and several othere pieces of information that would be needed to make this a reality if it were to be voted in.  Unfortunately, this amounts to nothing more than a shower thought in its current form and is simply not at all useful as a result.\n\nA proper technical proposal looks something more like [DCP0001](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0001/dcp-0001.mediawiki).\n\nAll of that said, and aside from the fact this is not even close to being a proper proposal, the concept of ProgPoW for Decred gets a hard pass from me.","signature":"04fd8bb4fc10cfcc496c5068495bffef7bec5e1b38b06fd80ab3ad29b1c0ce009fb42425c04f1ba46b34e08b301b5190b9505cd64a7bd4807da306a43cf97c0d","publickey":"937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","commentid":"1","receipt":"319cd54f6c164120a80be2b166605ca2894e1c32b34c94bb20d3d595ff7de853272c3267f69bd50414b6b3e222d0f6b8c4a8e2454b94d70d970b9ae6aa40e50c","timestamp":1542045474,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This Proposal doesn't specify anything related to WHO would do the work, HOW and  WHEN.\n\nOn the content,  I believe this is an horrible idea.... GPUs are more vulnerable to large \"Chinese\" mining farms because there is far less risk to build a GPU farm than using ASICs.  With a GPU farm you can change the coin you mine as often as you want, and even resell the hardware for it's real purpose (gaming). You don't really have skin in the game.\n\nWith an ASICs farm,  you can only mine one coin, you cannot resell easily, the risk is higher to get stuck with that hardware. You are quite a bit more invested in the currency you mine.\n\nMaybe the only moment that argument would hold IMO is when a coin is already exclusively mined on GPUs and a new ASIC could be made in secret and take over.  However  in an well established coin like Decred where we have multiple ASICs manufacturers and a strong governance system which can keep miners in check I see this suggestion as an immense step back in security.","signature":"42014516845f978fef58ff9e1b3963006fb2e3d8191803cf865087af251c3cbd1171528ebf19a759389f9444b0eaceec1d1811e6621b92dcd5568d685b5f200f","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"2","receipt":"b63c6ac83c325b6cfcc47ec43d1b9d9a27bfebf9156f193dc76eed4b598cdd552a3ab537819fbdf52869d7cc439397e088636dfd35ccd98a391e138c5cbfb603","timestamp":1542045691,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
