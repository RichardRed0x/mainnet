It is a complete and total waste of stakeholder's time as written, because it does not contain any of the technical details necessary to make it work with Decred, budgetary requirements, deployment considerations, a discussion of the myriad negative consequences of such a change to balance the perceived benefits, a discussion of compatibility characteristics, and several othere pieces of information that would be needed to make this a reality if it were to be voted in.  Unfortunately, this amounts to nothing more than a shower thought in its current form and is simply not at all useful as a result.\n\nA proper technical proposal looks something more like [DCP0001](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0001/dcp-0001.mediawiki).\n\nAll of that said, and aside from the fact this is not even close to being a proper proposal, the concept of ProgPoW for Decred gets a hard pass from me.","signature":"04fd8bb4fc10cfcc496c5068495bffef7bec5e1b38b06fd80ab3ad29b1c0ce009fb42425c04f1ba46b34e08b301b5190b9505cd64a7bd4807da306a43cf97c0d","publickey":"937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","commentid":"1","receipt":"319cd54f6c164120a80be2b166605ca2894e1c32b34c94bb20d3d595ff7de853272c3267f69bd50414b6b3e222d0f6b8c4a8e2454b94d70d970b9ae6aa40e50c","timestamp":1542045474,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
