Sweepstakes

**Sweepstakes**

**Abstract**

A DCR raffle system where the rules and odds of winning
are very transparent and the "house" earns a small percentage
which will be converted into income for new Decred projects.

The platform will draw amounts of DCR, these
quantities are accumulated by the participants themselves at the time of purchase
of tickets. 

**Why? **

because the participants have fun and have a transparent chance to accumulate between 100 and 10 
thousand times more that bet and create greater sustainability for the Decred project.


**First draw proposals:**

Are different types of raffles with different prizes
and chances of winning, all automated and decentralized and transparent.

There are 3 initial raffle sessions, each with a different percentage of chance of winning.

-session of 0.97% (award of 100 DCR)
-session of 0.097% (award of 1000 DCR)
-sessiom of 0.0097% (award of 10000 DCR)





**----- Session of 0.97% (24 hours)**


100 DCR Drawings:

Sales of tickets begins for the draw of 100 DCR
- Participants can buy a total of 103 tickets (there is no ticket limit per person, the odds are proportional)

- Each ticket is worth 1 DCR (totaling 103 DCR),
If the draw is able to raise the full amount of 103 DCRs by 24 hours, they will be made as soon as the total is accumulated.
100 DCR will be sent to the address of the ticket drawn and 3 for the development of Decred, if the lottery does not collect the total,
at the end of those 24 hours, will be done in the same way, respecting the percentage of 97% for the winner and 3% for the house, as well
that finalized, another lottery will replace it, with the same rules.

**----- Session of 0.097% (168 hours)**

1000 DCR Drawings:

Sales of tickets begins for the draw of 1000 DCR
- Participants can purchase a total of 1020 tickets (there is no ticket limit per person, the odds are proportional)

- Each ticket is worth 1 DCR (totaling 1030 DCR),
If the draw is able to raise the full amount of 1030 DCR before the 168 hours complete, it will be done as soon as the total is accumulated.
1000 DCR will be sent to the address of the ticket drawn and 30 for the development of Decred, if the lottery does not collect the total,
at the end of those 168 hours, the lottery will be made in the same way, respecting the percentage of 97% for the winner and 3% for the house, as well
that finalized, another lottery will replace it, with the same rules.

**
----- Session of 0.0097% (720 hours)**

10000 DCR Drawings:

Sales of tickets begins for the draw of 10000 DCR
- Participants can buy a total of 10300 tickets (there is no ticket limit per person, the odds are proportional)

- Each ticket is worth 1 DCR (totaling 10300 DCR),
If the draw is able to raise the entire amount of 1030 DCR before 720 hours, it will be done as soon as the total is accumulated.
10000 DCR will be sent to the address of the ticket drawn and 300 for the development of Decred, if the lottery does not collect the total,
at the end of these 720 hours, the lottery will be made in the same way, respecting the percentage of 97% for the winner and 3% for the house, as well
that finalized, another lottery will replace it, with the same rules.


----- **Conclusion:**

These are just three examples of sweepstakes that can be carried out with total transparency, are just three examples that I created and that I think would be interesting to implement but not necessary, if the sweepstakes proposal goes by itself, other sweepstakes proposals can be implemented within it.
