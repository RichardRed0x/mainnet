The merits of the underlying ideas aside, there is no information pertaining to how this would be implemented or who would do the actual work.

I think Politeia _could_ also work if users submit requests for features, with an appropriate tag, for example, that others can act upon and propose something substantial. This way not only the people with an idea and capabilities can take active part in governance. It clutters up the platform, however, but gives an idea of what users would like to see implemented, albeit it may turn out to be a sillt or infeasible idea.","signature":"b2c2fc3d11b42e40bddf33afbcef279bc24b975ae905f3598644a8efd16b79d2b66e7290847bf9ffcb68bdc82d1c9634e2e1242cf95c0acdd8a9a2133c277b01","publickey":"cdf12d5af8ce9769916c18704765c771b718783d4385be8d3248defc4d94c068","commentid":"3","receipt":"7212a4a3fc7bc60a6ac5661b455a192c46457daeaf7ce8cdf5064e375fe964b075be7932ab41c707ed9b718db022c216107a810a85d25d0b681138444eeb880e","timestamp":1541498785,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
