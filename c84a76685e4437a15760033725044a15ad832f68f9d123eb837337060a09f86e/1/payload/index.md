2019 Marketing Plan Funding
**What?**


Approval of funding for marketing tactics for the remainder of 2019.

**Why?**

The objective is to increase transparency and transfer control over the allocation of funds to the stakeholders. To this point in the project, much of this type of work has taken place, but without the review, input or approval of the stakeholders. For example, Decred has a website and spent money to build it, paid for events, promotional items, etc.

I believe this proposal will help move Decred towards a DAE where stakeholders have the power to authorize expenditures, but contributors have the autonomy to make decisions within an approved framework. The goal is to help establish sets of parameters to determine how this new type of organization will run.

The contents within this plan are those I believe will have the greatest impact given their level of expenditure. This budget takes into careful consideration the state of the Decred Treasury, and the objective is to help communicate the intrinsic value of Decred to yield a more rational market, expand the community, and acquire new developer talent.

**How?**

There will be two types of budgetary buckets included in the proposal, with budgets associated with each item within the plan.

1. Planned Programming


2. Discretionary Spending



**Planned Programming will include the following:**

- **Decred Assembly:** A monthly high production video featuring news of the project, community members, and deep dives into specific subject areas of interest. Videos will be shot at [Zacuto studios](https://www.zacuto.com/zacuto-studios), and guests will appear in person or be skyped in. This will allow us to incorporate contributors from anywhere in the world provided they have an internet connection.


- **Monthly Email Newsletter:** A truncated version of The Decred Journal, easy to review and digest, less technical, designed to enable more people to keep up with Decred. The newsletter will include the top 5-10 things that happened over the past month or will happen over the next month, and will include links to longer form coverage such as the Journal, external sites, or internal chats. We will allow for sign-up on the website, and we'll dump in the thousands of email addresses who have opted into receipt of marketing communications at various conferences in 2018.


- **Website Updates:** Reflect the new messaging, improve navigation, better explain Decred. The website is the top of the funnel for Decred, and we need to build it out. When someone reads about Decred in Forbes or Breaker, they go to the site to learn more. The crypto world changes quickly, and much of our site content and navigation is two years old. We've recently updated our messaging and positioning, and it makes sense to integrate that into the site. Additionally, I think there is opportunity to add subpages detailing Decred that would provide a cleaner bridge between the current landing page and docs.decred.org. These subpages include **Security** (Hybrid PoW/PoS consensus system), **Adaptability** (Full detail of Decred's governance, including blockchain governance and project level governance, staking, tickets, etc.), **The History of Decred** (Timeline with key events, explanation of air-drop, origin story), **Self-Funding** (A new way to organize work, explanation of how to work for Decred, list of areas people can contribute). Additionally, we'd like to re-orient the navigation to make finding relevant content easier, and we'd like to build a smoother on-ramp to help new developers and contributors understand how the contractor system works and how they can jump in and work for Decred. We also need to produce a new overview video for the homepage that reflects where Decred is now, along with the new messaging. The 65K USD is an approximation, likely an upper bound, for the costs in time that will be needed for Dustorf (marketing), Eeter (design), and the dev team to write/create and implement a fully updated site.


- **Internship Program:** Structure, package and promote a program to get college students to 	dev for Decred in the Summer of 2020. Budgeting for the cost of devs would be additional and would fall in the devs budget). We would like to create the program, promote is using Ditto's media outreach, and syndicate it across the world using our community organizers, whom we will ask to make connections at local Universities.


- **Decred in Depth Podcast:** Hosted and produced by Anshawblack, a deep dive with Decred community members on topics of interest. This involves pre-production, extensive topic research, audio recording, post-production, editing, mixing, mastering, and distribution fees. The shows would be done in studio, and topics include: DCR Thesis Overview + SoV Narrative + Economics with Murad Mahmudov, Decred Security Spend + 51% Attack Defense with Zubair Zia, 
DEX Implementation + DCR 2019 Roadmap + DCR Privacy + DCR Time with Jake Yocom-Piatt, Politeia Design + DAE Infrastructure + DCR Future with Marco Peereboom, and many more. They would be available on the decred.org website as well.


- **Community Organizers:** To build local Decred communities across the world. Attend meetups, organize quarterly Decred events, promote the project locally, social media activity, exchange outreach, swag etc. Target markets include: Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, New York, San Francisco, Australia, London, Germany, Portugal, Poland, China, Russia, Italy, Toronto, Middle East/Arabic, Hong Kong, Chicago, Brazil, Japan. These efforts will help us expand breadth and depth across the world, which will also help to lower the costs of event participation because local assets should be available.


**Discretionary Spending**

- The planned programming will set forth a base around which other contributors can identify supplemental needs and opportunities.  They can make their own proposals to better round out Decred’s 	marketing activities to the community in #Marketing or #Marketing ops. Consensus within the DCC (or current state) team could approve these 	additions so long as they fall within the approved budgeting in this area. Examples might include a gifted writer who launches a regular blog, a series of “How to” instructional videos to make Decred easier to use for newbies, and so on. I have people approach me all the time about contributing, but I don't feel comfortable approving activities without stakeholder approval. This would allow existing and new contributors to begin new tactics without a Politeia proposal so long as the endeavor is within the approved budget.


- New Opportunities. When the Decred team is approached with new ideas or partnerships, 	the marketing ops team will have the autonomy to make additions to the plan so long as 	budget exists.

**Who?**

Although I am making this proposal and heavily involved in many of the tactical executions, the objective is to gain stakeholder approval for those who work on behalf of Decred to be able to do so with a high level of autonomy. Each of the tactics involves a team of Decred contributors, and the idea is to use the DCC to track expenses and manage performance once it is up and running.

Dustorf will host Decred Assembly

Max will manage the Newsletter

Dustorf/Linnutee/Devs will manage Website

Dustorf will manage Internship

Anshawblack will manage Podcast

Marketing Ops/Marketing will be the place decisions are made on new expenditures (so long as there is budget)

**When?**

This proposal will begin upon approval, and funding will last through the end of 2019. A new proposal will need to be submitted for 2019, or for any new budgetary items beyond the scope of this proposal.
