I also find the asks for the various components reasonable based on my past experience on related projects (although at this high level I'm making a lot of assumptions).\n\nFor clarity, this vote is currently for a 220000 USD equivalent in DCR budget for planned activities and 70000 for potential new activities, and would operate as a budget (where only actual cost/hrs are paid for activities and there is shared responsibility to end the year at or below the target budget)?  For example, if only 10 of the 20 suggested community members get local events rolling we might expect the end of year spending to come in at approximately 50,000 USD for that line item rather than 100,000?\n\nI was also curious about studio quality at the named studio for the Decred Assembly reboot (very exciting by the way) and found this demo video that others might appreciate:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9LBrwOg6qc\n\nSmall correction - I think on the \"When?\" in the last sentince you mean \"a new proposal will be submitted for 2020\".","signature":"ba89d6ea48d33867ef9eb80778b04a7fcef60356a1fd4e90c6b0cbfe49f0f54d150dd9c439656a92cb8a6ce4a47e92a2379afda963864930f90b779b1153bd0f","publickey":"6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","commentid":"1","receipt":"26351647d27749c9956e64342e7735cb0161eb219165594f79244bd7a384ffeada6c6f879ff4ea6502d4202b660a268a41ae4ea6e0f6c55be8b697918bd46c0b","timestamp":1550526344,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
