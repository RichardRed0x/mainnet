However, I think parts of this should be split off into smaller proposals.\n\nThe website redesign/updates won't be a regular, recurring thing (i.e. we don't expect to do the same thing again in 2020), so it seems that should be a separate proposal, with more detail.\n\nAlso, I would prefer if each of the community organizers submitted their own budget, with further details on what they're specifically doing.\n\nIf the stakeholders are to properly manage treasury funds, there must be transparency in how they're spent. With the possible exception of your Discretionary Spending budget, the other items not mentioned earlier seem very clear and transparent, but for the items mentioned above, it seems like we're throwing money at vague ideas, and this could quickly develop into an opaque bureaucracy.\n\nThank you for all the work you do, and for taking the time to submit this proposal.","signature":"bb25c71ebdab0971bcfba110dd507b3ca3e588c4283d2f46c58aba010fb1fd698c754001ccd8d5e4aaf7812fd8ff782a30d5d7b5a748a71fdbbec92ac2ec9209","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"7","receipt":"9af930eb24f36490f1e6975a8d1650716f13a4d2881f20ec90a229ba22ab2dfcb7c918472563bf57dfeb5de87caec143c6560f1442b33dca7f6ffc8e8dbca106","timestamp":1550799678,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
