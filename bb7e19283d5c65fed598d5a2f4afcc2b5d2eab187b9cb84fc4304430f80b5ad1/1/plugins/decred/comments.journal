It was several years ago, before Bcash's time, so it's possible the following assumption may not apply to Bcash ATMs, but my experience with a different crypto ATM is:\n\nThe coins are significantly marked up to begin with, then the ATM takes a trading fee. Couple that with charging the actual coin community a premium for being available on the ATM, and it sounds to me like the ATM owners are trying to dip their feet into as many revenue streams as possible. (Not a bad business plan, but something I don't think serves any benefit to Decred).\n\nI would be curious to hear specific numbers on the markup, fees, specific monthly users, and monthly maintenance costs involved with having DCR available on these ATMs. I know Bcash has no obligation to share this information, but it would help me make a final decision either way.\n\nFor DCR, I feel that the only appeal of this proposal is the marketing aspect. Other than that, I don't see any other reason to vote for this.","signature":"f077b1d6d596e05f6d600a2a4829c3d00e450deb8a2e7eae336c4889087c2c3edbe33dd062dd2ff654474c2f822afd7517b82e6242834dc6b1d12e500aeb970e","publickey":"51a079b65d37ffa34a90ea52b92c60e818167eee597aee86b14200ce834fc5ba","commentid":"4","receipt":"9882fa1822e473d79c956ef43c5b810a66f909756af8bc5077fca28411cdf8fc5f6f2423117d9ef7ca730c930a19f32f98592da839f2a8736fc850903a164602","timestamp":1543434807,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
