Decred integration into Crypto-ATMs
**What**

We are proposing an integration of Decred to our Crypto-ATMs (https://bcash.eu) so people could buy and sell the coin from our ATMs. Bcash™ company manufactures ATMs and operate them as well. Currently we have Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash and Bitcoin Cash in our machines. Today we have 12 ATMs in Greece (will be 14 by the end of the year), we are also operating and expanding in Poland, Bulgaria, UK. Sold more than 10 ATMs in Colombia and US. Our network is continuously growing and we evolve our business all the time.

This proposal includes integration to our servers, 24/7 tech support and customer assistance. We are happy to clarify any question in response to the community’s feedback.

**Why**

These are the reasons we believe Decred would benefit from the integration: 

1. New category of customers, new approach (via ATMs). We have a lot of experience with ATM business and we know exactly how to communicate with people. This is something that we have mastered.

2. Our ATMs bring awareness (especially to Greek audience), this will trigger coin investment movement and demand. Greek people love to make new discoveries, especially in cryptocurrency field.

3. TV channels and medias in general approach us on weekly basis, so ATMs are really good way of advertising. We don't really care about Facebook and Google ban on cryptocurrency, our network is growing because people meet us and talk about us, it's all about people.

4. Bcash™ company participated at WebSummit as one of the best startups (we met Decred there). We are in negotiations of big investment that will boost our expansion in EU and worldwide in general. Our ultimate goal is to create a global network of Crypto-ATMs under one umbrella and transform it into a cryptocurrency bank.

5. We are from Greece, where democracy was born and POLITEIA sounds just perfect. DECRED community follows the rules of real DIMOKRATEIA and we just love it!
