It was several years ago, before Bcash's time, so it's possible the following assumption may not apply to Bcash ATMs, but my experience with a different crypto ATM is:\n\nThe coins are significantly marked up to begin with, then the ATM takes a trading fee. Couple that with charging the actual coin community a premium for being available on the ATM, and it sounds to me like the ATM owners are trying to dip their feet into as many revenue streams as possible. (Not a bad business plan, but something I don't think serves any benefit to Decred).\n\nI would be curious to hear specific numbers on the markup, fees, specific monthly users, and monthly maintenance costs involved with having DCR available on these ATMs. I know Bcash has no obligation to share this information, but it would help me make a final decision either way.\n\nFor DCR, I feel that the only appeal of this proposal is the marketing aspect.

Of course we make a profit from ATMs usage but the expenses are much higher than you think. Our proposal includes a customer \u0026 tech support regarding DCR. Also another NODE for ATMs is not so easy to support (technically speaking), if fact it is an addition to our network that needs extra resources from our servers \u0026 continuous monitoring etc. DCR is not famous in Europe so we need to advertise it by our marketing department (social media staff, salesmen, ATM operators, online advertising, SEO campaigns, media coverage in general). The fact that DCR doesn't yet have any reliable mobile wallet also doesn't make things easier (our clients usually use Jaxx, Blockchain, Coinomi with ATMs). We won't be able to generate enough profit from DCR during the first year in order to cover our expenses.

How many machines do you expect to sell with Decred installed?\n\nIn another comment you stated that:\n\u003e DCR is not famous in Europe so we need to advertise it by our marketing department (social media staff, salesmen, ATM operators, online advertising, SEO campaigns, media coverage in general).\n\nThese costs are not mentioned in the budget. If these are the reasons for the high cost they should probably be described there.\n\nIt may be a good idea to consider amending your budget so that payouts relate to performance (metrics that Decred stakeholders will care about) in some way.","signature":"5979e22f363beb33922e620b06c4ad16ef2d242189f1b8aab3aa9ac193565abdbb34d1ea80b1c55453b0ab576733845435ece11c551eb9d65d94be3b9b4f9c0a","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"15","receipt":"9ff6c60b63b7d7cabc6d575b563fe1cdbaaefeca6928e6c9a47f100a2fdd8c45ffde479ba5adfcd65bb57a86e3d2fa8f00c121fec19fc8f41f41b23220b90200","timestamp":1543504514,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The following is a summary of the responses received so far:\n\n**GeneralBytes**\n* Machines: ~2000\n* Fees: $0\n* Marketing Requirement: None\n* Deployment Type: Push\n* Developer Responsibility: Decred\n* Process Provided: Decred would be responsible for development of the wallet installation by forking/modifying the open-source repository.  GeneralBytes would \"backport\" the wallet to existing machines.\n\n**Lamassu**\n* Machines: ~1000\n* Fees: $0\n* Marketing Requirement: None\n* Deployment Type: Pull\n* Development Responsibility: Decred\n* Process Provided: Decred would be responsible for development of the wallet installation by forking/modifying the open-source repository.  Decred would also be responsible for contacting ATM owners to suggest pulling the updated software or purchasing our own ATMs to release with the Decred software.\n\n**CoinFlip**\n* Machines: ~200\n* Fees: $10000\n* Marketing Requirement: 3 months of cross posting\n* Deployment Type: Push\n* Development Responsibility: CoinFlip\n* Proess Provided: Decred would pay the $10000 fee to cover development and deployment.  CoinFlip would develop and push the wallet to existing machines.  Both parties would agree to run 3 months of social media promotion.\n\nI have additional requests for information pending.  My recommendation is that we get more information as a community and take a pragmatic approach to ROI and market penetration.  Note that this information is based on initial emails with marketing managers and verification would be needed before an RFP or new proposal submission.  Based on limited information so far GeneralBytes is a strong ATM contender.  Any community experience with GB or other ATM providers?\n\nDimitrios and Giannis, I appreciate your effort making the first proposal to the Decred Community and sparking interest in ATMs.  I personally hope you come back with a more competitive proposal as we look for the right solution.","signature":"02938edaff5e719aec2fdc920ac23e15a3a75954c12b5f25194de4e7f89db3837089231a69ae350bf3dd615546cab2a9ab71daa4c47bb36b1532a9cc7c04fe0f","publickey":"6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","commentid":"22","receipt":"8cb2302fb8bbb16f7b7162091461c11daa89a03b21d7a29c44231f69e840cc1d03fdfa17eea4359724fdb625c875d2b33897eec89540d6cdaf40f6aa5e00a70e","timestamp":1543696087,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I appreciate your taking the time to engage with people about the proposal here. The additional offer to perform integration work with the other ATM providers makes this proposal interesting again.

In addition to including the development work would you consider dropping this part of your billing proposal?  I'm doubtful that it will pass with these fees included (although obviously I only speak for myself and am guessing at community sentiment).
