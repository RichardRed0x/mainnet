Can you provide some referral or contacts of other projects you have worked with so we can gather more feedbacks ? \n2.

May i suggest short period of trial stage, and after gathering more feedback from teams working with you guys we can slowly extend the period of commitment. \n4. \"Decred team\" was mentioned many times in the proposal. would you list a few (3-5) personnel from the \"Decred team\" and have you discussed the proposal personally with them?

My worry is that a firm with experience dealing with other cryptocurrencies in the space will find that Decred is a horse of a different wheelbase. We don't do hype, we build. We under-promise, over-deliver. \n\n\u003e As part of the company’s narrative, Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.\n\nI'd like to know Jake's thoughts on this. In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake. I greatly trust and respect him, and I expect he will have significant influence in the project for the foreseeable future, but we're not here to make a cult of personality around him.\n\nOverall, this looks like a great pitch for promoting a company, but Decred is not a company. It's a decentralized cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso, from the diverse list of clients, it seems to indicate that Wachsman will promote nearly any project that has funding available. I totally understand why a marketing company would do that from a revenue perspective. However, I wonder if it wouldn't be more effective to have marketing people who actually are sold on DCR themselves; they HODL DCR, they stake DCR, they're perhaps even active here on Politeia. In other words, take DCR community members who have marketing experience, and pay them to market DCR more effectively.\n\nIf we would go ahead with Wachsman, I would prefer a shorter trial period before committing to six months. Or is the current proposal cancelable at any time?\n\nDisclaimer: I tend to be a pessimist by nature, so my first reaction to any proposal is usually negative. I'm not 100% opposed; I want to keep an open mind.","signature":"a351616fb7cf93d5eb41011362dc4cd126f112d908eab71d3b294219b0271622a200d11c4b2830c6cf2658161ab1dba500b9715371d56c8acbceca6e977dcb04","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"4","receipt":"f9b3b9dda5405a025d1a3ddc6b48e6eb1334bfd71f756ee0db9997143694b60a16ad3c3f465706db1356fda15b85789b7c80bf6314a2ce2b645568ad31cbcd0f","timestamp":1540075014,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think Jake is a great ambassador for Decred. I have also seen JZ and Marco do great interviews. I am comfortable expanding the number of Decred personalities to include all three and so that we can deliver a consistent message.  \n\nWe have lots of very smart people in Decred, and several could/should be projected as thought leaders in the crypto space. One reason why I happen to like Decred is because we have more than one heavyweight personalities with strengths in certain areas. \n\nThe only issue that gave me pause on the proposal is the extensive list of crypto clients. Yes it's great they know crypto well. But clients include Dash and Horizen, which I might regard as competitors (even if I own some of the tokens on their client list). Would there be a conflict of interest? Probably not, but I want to raise the issue in case others can eliminate my doubts entirely or surface other concerns around that. \n\nThe cost of the proposal, given the international reach and apparent connections to media and event organizers, seems reasonable (and yes, I have worked with brand and marketing agencies in different areas of the globe). If we can negotiate further, I am all for that --- but let's give marketing some serious attention. \n\nI recognize that we wouldn't be here discussing this if it was not for the outstanding work of our developers and programmers. But well placed marketing is also important - and we must have presence with both retail crypto investors and institutional investors - globally. As our brand equity rises, so too will demand to hodl decred and participate in our governance system.","signature":"6591b8e8e79306102e35187989ea3c7545dc99e1035feddb56c51046a7101bf3c0467e87630ea31b7e43772cd289402f8d1afce0cb3f9cb163934e1493bec40e","publickey":"4ad431a4d546ed1cd631acaf08fa47e41f4e77c45b8057d3cf6ab516f6f284dd","commentid":"7","receipt":"4ef45c16f014cc6d60148885b7e4a861c38680df9ba8b1d6dc1a42f2e76e29ccad6d70eb5ce12c86f6e918d9e71beb069ec0c8a426d2207fca1ff7f44888c608","timestamp":1540084090,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Does anyone else get an eerie vibe from this in the sense that this proposal is essentially offering to sell us Decred's brand?\n\nI picked up on a lot of flashy \"marketing\" terms (no surprise there) and I'm always skeptical of marketing services in general. I would encourage others to also be skeptical of a marketing proposal offered by a marketing company (sorry Wachsman, but I know how marketing is). I do agree with the others who have suggested that Decred should have more general marketing services, but this proposal just comes off to me as an expensive \"brand in a box\" subscription service.\n\nA lot of the services offered are ones I doubt will even get used, and I don't think we need much assistance when it comes to event strategies - our current event group seems to be doing just fine.\n\nI don't think we need to pay for positive media. With the work that goes on to make Decred what it is, independent media outlets will continue to keep up with the project and our exposure will grow along side the project.","signature":"b571f306e3060049d0314fa840ff4e979ffb7ed4e38ebb76f8bb75a696f5f4f06ba55c3a53facaec939d2ec474824409d15235997f8ee34fb0bc65dca9a2ed04","publickey":"51a079b65d37ffa34a90ea52b92c60e818167eee597aee86b14200ce834fc5ba","commentid":"8","receipt":"08f06815ad7f35b4f58f7de0aab0e8c36d06a1816bc475c85feb8cdcbe6b9abbef6775311ad977eee3e35dceab32f6dd8f56c54b1cadfdf3b4f70a2343a6d30c","timestamp":1540087978,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Especially as Marco and Jake leveraging their cred and visibility in the crypto community. I think Decred could use a lot of help with media coverage. I've been obsessively researching crypto for a couple years. Just discovered Decred a couple months ago, and that was through a convert at a meetup. That Decred only got their first CoinDesk article a couple weeks ago is crazy.

This is not just about advertising, this proposal seems to focus a lot on communication, events and public speaking, which is a good idea in my opinion. \n\nCaution must be taken though not to make decred appear like a corporate for profit entity that spends a lot on marketing and tries to attract investors.  \nThat would not resonate well within the cryptocurrency community, but from the proposal it looks like the provider is well aware of the core values of decred. \n\nThe current branding (logo, stakey, graphics are very very good, clean and nicely designed and I would not change the branding at all. \n\nIf we have one very professional provider who is able to add significant value to decred, then I would support having one provider with a clear plan and structure as opposed to countless scattered marketing proposals. \n\nI have the impression that decred is not very present at conferences and relevant gatherings in Europe yet, not sure about Asia as well, so my hope would be to get the word out beyond the United States where many team members appear to be based.","signature":"9c5a5e8bac8910838569fbad9a305c3bc322869a7cc894569e647fd4437ad9c0d3c18579230ec1d596525202dc51f26318af46923d32a9a8bb57b9013d0d7103","publickey":"e1016f5f45877b4c4aa85d9f7beabbe2bafbdabe0269b213d4046dc5ed61689a","commentid":"13","receipt":"480c5f9d3715edc35049d176617c2bef229c1f4c19418d0c82c3cb12bc2cc03985960f8a2ad7e31dfbc36e3d98779ecaa1eb9bd183276b414f215c542bdf880b","timestamp":1540099939,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I was one DCR team members listening in on the presentation call. My impression with Wachsmans brief presentation was positive, as they focused on quite real practicalities and describing a methodical way of doing things (on PR and Events fronts) rather than attempting to sell the project based on past clients rep. or vague promises. \n\nAs a designer, i'm very considerate about the optics and how different actions effect the reputation of the project. I'm largely in favour of the proposal, as it's mostly sound and proportionate in the ways it relates to these matters. \n\nAfaik there is not a conflict of interest with their other crypto clients, as there's different employees assigned to these projects, nevertheless this needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts. \n\nIn response to some comments preferring only the current \"grass-roots\" approach and fears around giving off so called \"corporate vibe\" – these cases should not be looked at in a black and white manner. Decred needs a solid PR \u0026 events output and professional presence just as much as it needs the friendly enthusiasts and community hotheads. One does not have to conflict the other. I would imagine worse future outcomes if DCR happens to lack on the professional front – as then it simply may not be taken seriously and get the foot through the door when needed. One must not forget, this is a financial product after all. \n\nTo give an illustrated example, quoting one of my past critiques around overusing and turning the spaceman jacket into a bad gimmick if presented wrong context: \n“I am an investor or a person working at relevant business/institution visiting a conference with aim to connect with xyz crypto projects – see a number of professional and respectable looking talkers. Last talk is Decred. I don’t know what Decred is yet. See someone looking like a clown come to the stage. Red flag hits, leave before it starts as the first impression is ruined and i’ve got better things to do.” First impression one won’t get to re-do. \n\nThere are certain marketing and PR approaches that are fundamentally incompatible with DCR imo, for example: deeply sales oriented and high-pressure sales tactics; \"fishsalesmen type\" hype/spam campaigns relying on overpromising, dumbing down; dishonest, misleading or very clickbaity communications for content or campaign advertising, all kind of referral/multi-level marketing schemes. I don't think any of these are present here.\n\n**Media Training + Speaker positioning** \n\nThis service should certainly be focused on. Correct me if i'm wrong, but in the long term DCR will need many topnotch spokespersons rather than relying primarily on Jake and Marco, as neither wish to build images of a central figures. Ideally this service can be leveraged to help train existing community members up, to be better enquipped for the role. Meaning DCR will in the long run have many adept spokespersons. Giving presentations and interviews is simply another skill that can always be improved through work and training. I find it negligible if situation occurs where people who are untrained or with little to no experience end up giving presentations, interviews etc about the project.\n\n**Key Messaging and Brand Narrative Development + Content Creation**\n\nThis is the only item I have some concerns about. There are three people listed in the team with mostly directional roles, however none with a dedicated focus on creative copywriting or a creative strategy work. (These are marked as secondary roles.)\n\nWorking out key messaging + a communications strategy and documenting it in a reasonable way has been an item that I've discussed with 2 or 3 no longer present marketing contributors, of who none successfully delivered any useful results. So this should not be taken lightly. \n\nAlthough DCR has a number of excellent in-house writers, I would say we've always been missing the creative copywriting types. The issue here is that documentation writing, research writings, journalism writings and creative copywriting are all very different animals. A lot of the comms. output so far has been written by a group. Comparing it objectively to brands who have it created by dedicated professionals – these will never be on the same level.\n\nWhen it comes to creative copywriting, communication strategy creation and such – to get something actually useful worked out in DCR's context, this task absolutely needs at least one specialized senior level copywriter (or creative director, strategist whatever the title w/ similar background) with a strong, demonstrable track-record (e.g. case studies). Reason being that the scope itself is already way too big for a non-dedicated or directional roles to cover: building an deep understanding, creating objectives and devising strategies to accomplish them, concepting work, creative problem solving, imaginativness and eye for detail, going in-depth with calibrating the voice and articulations, having an understanding of various aspects of branding, awarness and ability to tell difference between short lived trends and timeless techniques, strong judgement and projection skills on outcomes, ability to sync with the design direction, etc… You get my point.\n\nAlso in case there's plan of using shadow-writers to assist the key personnel – this has been tried and did not work well. I'm in favour of the actual people doing the work being behind the table and accountable.\n\nThis essentially will work as a tool and a standard for everyone who wants to communicate about Decred – meaning that tangible deliverables and well accessible documentation of the work are of importance here. For one potential benchmark, I would suggest to take a look at the project https://brand.estonia.ee/story/core-messages/ where quite reasonable communication guidelines were developed for a large (and obviously even harder to define) entity – this being a country, but it's end use case is similar to DCR as it's meant for very different businesses and individuals.\n\nObviously one of the most difficult parts of the project will be getting the ultimate agreement on what goes. I'm well aware that having too many cooks in the kitchen will mess up the work and I obviously don't recommend this. Preferably the concept development process could include a small number of expert contributors covering the key disciplines of the projects. Only once a rough consensus on a solution is agreed, this can be brought out for larger reviewing. Also type of involvement, tasks and responsibilities for each participant should be well defined from the start to. \n\nTo wrap things up, my questions are: \n- Can you elaborate on this item, your process and the deliverables output for this work? \n- Do you plan on involving more talent to cover this front? \n\nThanks.","signature":"ed11f934b4e1583f599e0293cc52b9c3a69035c55c2c8a58ef6c2b1c35d6c98d1b4b47a99a4d90c7c1a8fb5090d6aa90210bf8fb4e588db3597b72a989f95508","publickey":"23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","commentid":"18","receipt":"25479acadcb07901f0e2bf6e31e3dad347a655c357037fae9e84c102431798f24d0d56a49b37b3e075fafccec228f74b3ab83fe402edec81cb2da98fd0a9e704","timestamp":1540223542,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The fact that Decred is a horse of a different wheelbase isn’t just a major draw for us — it’s a notion that we anticipate will be exceptionally (and justifiably) well-received by the media as well. This is especially true for the more “mainstream” reporters, many of whom will honestly just hang up the phone if they hear “ICO” or “Token Sale.” \n\n\u003e We don't do hype, we build. We under-promise, over-deliver.\n\nVery, very good call here. This would absolutely be our recommendation as well. \n\nWachsman’s goal is never to merely promote hype around a project, it is to demonstrate to the wider blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mainstream communities the inherent value propositions of our clients in a non-hyperbolic way. Wachsman endeavors to act as a megaphone through which Decred’s message can be heard by a greater audience, bringing those with whom this message resonates with into the community. \n\n\u003e  In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake.\n \nWhile we completely understand the importance of maintaining decentralization, from a media (and events) standpoint we feel that it is exceptionally important for there to be at least one — but likely more depending on the communications vertical — advocate/ambassador that is available and media trained to communicate Decred’s story to the world and distinguish Decred from competitors (it is my understanding that we will be doing media training for 6+ individuals, but are more than happy to offer it to more people, as needed). \n\nThis is exceptionally important when it comes to communication verticals like thought leadership/ expert commentary. Wachsman has mainstream reporters reaching out to us daily for quick commentary, and the ability to have an established representative from Decred readily available to turn around initial thoughts on breaking news is hugely beneficial for securing coverage. We anticipate that during our engagement we will work closely with the Decred community as a whole, but in the interest of keeping Decred on people’s radar outside of major announcements, suggest a strong media presence for select team members at least in the immediate future.","signature":"4418dfa696e3b15a14ac1d9a2a5833fdf27f3111ee65e09adaa2da25a1adccac25b588e25635eb1193337a9520b6a1bf0443973784d23b8b7996fc9ae7b96408","publickey":"2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","commentid":"20","receipt":"a9aa2336fadcca1cc62a61f0a0d151d3ff04a3f68e07cc72827a5b73bfed2ac866ed7ad0d9c8927b0ec70781b52da0f784d476fc4f9464679feb8ecc00a9b90a","timestamp":1540232829,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Wachsman will never pay for media placements for our clients, nor will we deploy advertising budgets. We strongly believe that the best way to generate brand awareness and exposure is through organic media exposure based primarily on the core value propositions of our clients, and the communication of these value propositions to the relevant members of the media in a strategic and measured manner. \n\nWachsman are true admirers of the community Decred has built as well as the values on which it was built upon, and we would never tarnish these values by offering Decred a “brand in a box” proposal. What we endeavor to do is to magnify the achievements already made by the Decred community, and the achievements which Decred will undoubtedly make in the future by communiticating them to the world in the correct manner, a manner which is in line with these founding values and the long term goals and ambitions of Decred.\n\n\u003e With the work that goes on to make Decred what it is, independent media outlets will continue to keep up with the project and our exposure will grow along side the project.\n\nThis is certainly true to an extent, and congratulations are definitely in order given the project’s success to date. It is our firm belief, however, that given the amazing growth of the project so far - and all the significant milestones to come - Decred deserves a robust expansion of media coverage. What Decred is doing is truly exceptional and you have all worked hard to get here — ** everyone ** should know about it!\n\nFurthermore, it is worth stressing the value of a strategic approach to media, as opposed to one that is merely reactive and ad hoc. There is immense value in controlling your narrative and having news come from you — not just being about you and out of your control. Wachsman has spent years developing unmatched relationships with media (both in trade and mainstream) and as such is uniquely suited to navigate the media landscape, knowing when and which reporters to offer select pitches and announcements to — ultimately striving to have more control over when and what things are said about Decred and how the project is positioned by the media.","signature":"e70bd21e5994c60cb67cd472796209d2d78a8f636038e60656ce4388b41c0b706527845e1d84d6670efd1610fa91d50a09b3e32bc5bf9fe5bd3f77ca25e5f302","publickey":"2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","commentid":"21","receipt":"af4ea34f93286db0b83c2cb376535a52a51f24955fbc6e2bab68b13d14a112041e77ce00d51fcfcda677911a609d61002ec7f7c9c577d3978b345ab019ba050c","timestamp":1540233005,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As we have grown in offering and indeed number, so too have our overheads; to that end, our monthly retainer has increased.","signature":"1d8cfe2de92f7f8acc2a8917bb6287ee4985c6495106413f8245a110a1ece20d23bf0740e3da53228ad4dfc33b400e53512ecfed8ea965a04f4b38a961f7e907","publickey":"2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","commentid":"26","receipt":"5c419f031e3ac8b2755d1d640a5bd74a6aa4f6137ebae3bd7b9d1f47394a6bb271dea482f450e2c26d3e025643ea9b94f81367bfc1b74c648258fce433e40f0f","timestamp":1540233475,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We will never pay for media placements for our clients, nor will we deploy advertising budgets. We strongly believe that the best way to generate brand awareness is through organic media exposure based primarily on the core value propositions of our clients. That being said, Wachsman’s communications expertise would dramatically increase the chances of such exposure through refining of messaging, navigating turbulent news cycles, and proactively controlling the narrative around Decred.\n\nAs a result of operating in the earned media space, Wachsman do not operate off a KPI basis, as simply put, there can be no guarantees.

Our first, second, and third goal for the Decred campaign would be to organically drive adoption of the project by raising awareness of its overall mission and success to date in both the cryptocurrency and mainstream communities. There is a lot of noise in this industry — so much so that even the best projects in the world can be overlooked if they don’t position themselves carefully. I mentioned this elsewhere, but the Decred community has worked exceptionally hard to get where it is today — we think that everyone interested in crypto should know that.","signature":"a5a4f5f7b1dcbb51b16edde28d854d7ef8999a1c58524b3b981a81917b9f81d82db392d81595c076951313a95c53ad045254937c940c157cce30b099fef8e707","publickey":"2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","commentid":"30","receipt":"5a85bdfbb804ccb4f2232b74b206b00884144de905b78450355445bb9fb17203be18e87cd971894c8e70ce69ca2cc0f5131e0b782e5d65a7efd90f981a497409","timestamp":1540233898,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Wachsman’s unique and very dedicated team structure (as opposed to being comprised of overextended individuals focused “here and there” on entirely different accounts) enables us to do a very deep drive into a client's tech and language. Frankly, it’s the only way blockchain communications work — this tech and media landscape is far too complicated for people to try to focus on twenty different projects at a time. \n\nWachsman would work very close with the Decred representatives/ community because we would ultimately view ourselves as part of that community — going very in depth with our understanding of the Decred project.

I initiated this process 3-4 weeks ago, narrowed down my search, and involved approximately eight to ten members of the Decred team in the vetting process. These names are familiar such as JZ, jy-p, Richard Red, Joshuam, Linnutee, and LukeBP. The plan would be to have a weekly call with Wachsman, and access to that call would likely be available to those qualified to participate, and/or all on mute mode. We want everyone to know what's going on, but we don't want to bring things to a stand still with too many cooks in the kitchen. One outcome of a successful PR partner will be more marketing activity and more internal communications regarding said marketing activity.","signature":"6ed7dd60e346fb30c05f7ce2b901ecf552f1b3a0876559a5e9009f11232a5401b901bf2b339a4d270f94c4a800c5d515622d8ad514ac0da4a4eebc70bcb22303","publickey":"2cfe1335346e419a3f00fc3672c1a53ebcc1c15f48d3e9e174af7356be14bc5a","commentid":"34","receipt":"d81250055381c1bf496a6b9320a876e90537264398293e91f3539bafaaeea7daae636292b864d3e8d87f1a36409ee6bd97934551600e83e6182af28d47729c01","timestamp":1540257334,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I've attended the DASH conference and saw how Wachsman PR worked for them. DASH paid not only for PR but for a full rebrand into a more commercial product. As a result, the core team decided to be more hands off and assumed that PR is \"covered\". Dash core stopped answering questions about DASH development and started becoming more distant and corporate. All communication with the core team was \"filtered\" via and it felt very distant. \n\nIronically this alienated a huge portion of the DASH community and hindered the development work. If you want to spend money on advertising, best find / hire someone who is passionate and can explain what DCR does. Maybe some tutorials about staking / voting.","signature":"34006faa21b278617f367481525f02a6b2549fcefeb27928bbdf57b8578aac4060324ddbb0ddfa4b582ac8d1d08c4b2dc4e3d03b9b3bae81e96ab44bbf456c06","publickey":"459b9d7915b5d4c89ac5d7367eede8f3ff29c2a6379faba05bf05879fceaccb0","commentid":"39","receipt":"029950a1983df4d498c599827072475cd7dfa2fe0465b875a679fcd230150b0b6a6f26a211704c0d8b04a4ac934d08c89b4bc4e3cca4d1c5ba5f34e6a7b31005","timestamp":1540319528,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The majority of our clients are startups, so we understand how valuable time is.\n\nOne of the things I’ve noticed when companies meet with us is they say, “You know, our last PR firm had good ideas but it just translated to more work for us. And we don’t have time to do all that.” We pride ourselves in making sure Ditto does all the heavy lifting. Doesn’t mean we won’t need some of your valuable time. But it’s also why we are considered the “anti PR Agency.” We do things the right way, which isn’t how other PR firms do it.\n\nA good PR plan actually takes time OFF your schedule. If we create a smart plan, prioritize, etc., Ditto can then execute without having to bother you too much. I’d argue a good PR plan maximizes the time you have – not add on more time. And it’s why we don’t charge by the hour, like most PR firms. We’d much rather get BIG results in less time than the opposite of that.\n\nBacking up a little more, we work with developers ranging from coding bootcamps to founders to blockchain companies. So, we understand how to work with devs. Also, we are a new source for your community. A dev may have a question about something PR related, and Ditto is 24/7 on demand to answer any and everything.\n\nFinally, Ditto has succeeded and grown over the years based on one simple reason: we are results focused. It’s right in our little motto: Strategy, execution, results.","signature":"6edd8a0c3242a9fac9120b8bf20c7e19165fa08144133a6eb304f2460dd95f85b4cf0da822293d134a34d2abdbce7feb3417432b4a455b574f97159de7794104","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"40","receipt":"c6e6b36139a685ed3982aad56bc67f28b328fe3afbd3da8790c3faae321c375d6da6ff795c21cd0b0e7cd53f0f1364f1de5b159e2eecd0a42300eefbfabefc0e","timestamp":1540322888,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Covering the complete size of the team might help to clear the proportion of the price brought up in some comments.\n\nHowever, my concerns around brand comms strategy work remain. Can you provide any case studies that are relevant specifically in this area of operations and to the described deliverables, rather than journalism related items? I see the two being quite different animals after all. Basically i’m interested in seeing is the sheer creative and intellectual output in a brands own environment, where the tangible work can speak for itself. And this of the suggested copywriter(s)/strategists involved. \n\nAsking this as I didn’t come across any on your mainsite and only found some external reports that are covering mostly statistics and reach or journalism examples. \n\nConsidering all the work is completely remote, I think there will be a lot of playing-the-phone that will make it difficult to be synced up and most productive. I do consider the copywriter(s) on the task largely responsible for the creative output and assume it would be preferred from Decred team’s end to have them involved closely.","signature":"fd427d73622541b5c3dd7ef402455aa53a6926441fabdf314f6b1bc285a5d06bb389e3d2ad25be6dac4042a01fbb805ed58ee5a9a61c88ff532a4ae0d4f6c001","publickey":"23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","commentid":"41","receipt":"e7158429702117f6f3a2f10a8565544fdca502dc65a93697311c62708b211c24793f3f1905440cde436eb019c27040af7624c409c6974a08e121d994abc01c04","timestamp":1540327238,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We have seen time and time again with the company’s coming to us from other firms that it’s the only way you can service blockchain projects. Decred’s representatives, community, and developers are working tirelessly to do all the work you mentioned and more. None of this succeeds if we have to give you more work because we don’t have a big enough or experienced enough or committed enough team in place to service Decred. \nTake our events support for instance — the main reason that we began offering it to clients is because we saw many dedicating a ton of time to navigating the 700 plus crypto events (not to mention hundreds of events we can support you with in other verticals, like mainstream finance or tech) that come into their inboxes a year. With Wachsman, Decred’s representatives and community essentially won’t have to worry about anything related to events coordination other than booking flights and hotels. Speaker pitches, negotiating pricing with organizers, booth set up, even SWAG coordination — we’re taking it off your plate.\nThe very first thing that Wachsman would do when Decred comes on is have a full kickoff call with the community-chosen representatives of the project (on a conference call that you’re all more than welcome to listen in on). This kickoff call (frankly it’s a brain dump) lets our team get extremely well versed in the project, its timeline, its needs, hopes for positioning in the media, and more. We learn your project inside and out so that we can bring it to reporters and events organizers without needing to go back and forth to your team, slowing down the process and making more work for you. \nOur efforts will always look to highlight the amazing work of your team — not burden it.","signature":"9defff8d89de63bbd3f763ce84078c2767e71ce6de5722a4049459c41138f798fde61bd85968813aa0d95e4621578fcf25a0d9db56254f11e03f470c62f40908","publickey":"2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","commentid":"42","receipt":"87558cd513415d4fcaa456870eb5ab1874b481ad737f47fc98a903443d98bc90cb63355f2f25257cfb6b5f04b2903a2162b4a52509ed9af37c4c21cd5537db09","timestamp":1540393293,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Below are my questions are for version 6.\n\n1\\.\n\n\u003e This proposal includes a strategic communications and events campaign for Decred\n\nWho will run these events and pay for them?\n\nGenerally, is there any funding that may be required from Decred on top of this proposal's budget? If so, do you have an estimate?\n\n2\\.\n\n\u003e Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.\n\nIf too much attention is placed on Jake alone this can lead to decreased perceived decentralization of the project.\n\n3\\.\n\n\u003e Crisis Communications (...) limiting reputational impact\n\nInteresting, I'd love to understand this better. Say we have an incident, like a 12 hour network stall, or a serious vulnerability discovered. What specific steps do you imagine to reduce the damage? Are there any historic examples?\n\n4\\. Looking at your connections, do you have an idea why Decred was omitted by CoinDesk for 2 years until recently, while extensively featuring projects with much less delivery?\n\n5\\. Do you have any connections to attract more talented Go developers? Is it in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability.\n\n6\\. Can you please comment on your influence in non-English space, and any plans in scope of this proposal?\n\n7\\. Will you allocate someone to talk to community in text chats and update how Wachsman-Decred project is doing?\n\n8\\. Do you make any activity on social media? For example, if someone tries to pull an info attack on Decred using multiple Twitter accounts?\n\n9\\. Can you use textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for the materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work?\n\n10\\. Will you publish post-event analyses publicly?\n\n11\\. List of clients in the portfolio is impressive but only contains short descriptions of clients. Where can I learn about the actual work performed for them? Like a simple per-client list of actions taken, with some result analysis. linnutee asked a similar question with no reply so far.\n\n12\\. How to interpret all the linked articles? Are they written by Wachsman or did Wachsman assist in publishing?\n\n13\\. Why some of the linked articles feature Blockfolio and Ethereum while they are not in the list of clients? Also I'm puzzled by the ones featuring the giant rat and Roubini, is Bitcoin their 'client'?\n\n14\\. Did you work for Blockstream? (article about Liquid)\n\n15\\. Are the payments monthly?\n\n16\\. Is it possible to stop the (monthly) payments if stakeholders are not satisfied with the results after say 2-3 months? Or, alternatively, slowly ramp up the expenses based on deliverables. Asked a few times but answer so far.\n\n17\\. In one of the comments you mentioned due diligence services. That is interesting, could you e.g. help screening exchanges and wallets that integrate Decred?\n\n18\\. Was the call you had with Decred representatives recorded and is it available to the public?\n\n19\\. In case both Wachsman's and Ditto's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with Ditto?\n\n20\\. linnutee mentioned legal contracts, which contracts and with whom will be made?\n\nOn the text itself:\n\n1. Please avoid using tracking bits in the links, e.g. `#1716b3851e51` in the forbes.com link or the `utm_xxx` in coindesk.com links. Anti-privacy tracking links are bad in general, but are even worse for a site that is visited by stakeholders.\n2. `11.01.18 — 05.01.19`: please use international date format, month before day is [US-specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country). By the way a good PR direction is to make Decred look less US-centric.\n3. Small and totally my personal issue: the \"industry experts\" and \"leaders\" are the \"business speak\" terms that are abused to the point they _lower_ credibility for me. Unfortunately, too many entities are calling themselves experts and leaders.","signature":"bcd3421f8708ad2c3b8931ba6dbd24cbe868abc8aaba0d5fbfffc38c591e0bcb243283a0b54e0ba40f486773a87ec88ce9685cbc394c94bc217a57219a0dee0a","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"66","receipt":"ebea1ce2d3705055ffc766c956de877aa55f26d68fee91510d7bb16e44c6da9d93c9f9e09c5eb0d37ed6e3efcc3239cffbad5a69464baa434d17f4a6e4793907","timestamp":1540849230,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
