Wachsman Communications Proposal for Decred
**Wachsman Communications Proposal for Decred**

**Prepared by Wachsman: October 19, 2018**
 
The digital currency of the people, Decred is completely independent, community owned, and community funded. Launched in February 2016, Decred solves blockchain governance with an innovative consensus voting model that empowers stakeholders, improves security, enables scalability, and offers complete transparency. Having already won accolades from industry experts and the media, Decred is well positioned to definitively reshape the blockchain ecosystem. 

With the recent launch of Politeia, the time has arrived for Decred to have a full strategic communications plan in place that would put its stakeholders in control of its narrative and shape the news to further position Decred as a dominant player in the blockchain industry. 

As the leading provider of communications and events services to innovative technology companies in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries, Wachsman is uniquely positioned to develop and strengthen the narrative surrounding Decred and distinguish it from potential competitors. With over 120 staff members across offices in New York, Dublin, and Singapore, Wachsman represents many of the most recognizable companies in the industry.  A full list of Wachsman clients can be found [here](https://wachsman.com/portfolio/). 

The press echo chamber has become increasingly crowded with similar products and repeated trends, and the ability to stand out from the noise has, too, become more difficult. This proposal includes a strategic communications and events campaign for Decred engaging with key partners and stakeholders in mainstream business and finance press, as well as trade publications in the blockchain and crypto spaces and event organizers around the world. Wachsman will strive tirelessly to further build the Decred brand, enhance credibility and trust among the current Decred user base, and drive awareness among new potential users and strategic partners
 


**Core Mission**
Decred’s core values will be the bedrock of Wachsman’s strategic communications and events campaign; they include:

- Developing software that is both free and open-source;
- Constant development of privacy and security;
- Free speech and communication;
- Remaining community empowered through unmatched governance.


**Leadership**
Decred’s unique governance model and status as a truly community-driven project remain entirely unmatched, even in an industry that prides itself on decentralization. As part of the company’s narrative, Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.
 
**PR Objectives**
Wachsman will work closely with Decred to achieve the following communications objectives:

- Increase visibility around the Politeia governance system, and the inherent benefits of the model with its combination of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms;
- Attract new members to the community and increase developer adoption;
- Further differentiate Decred’s unique governance model from competitors;
- Communicate the value of a truly flat community structure;
- Amplify announcements and generate press coverage in both mainstream and cryptocurrency trade outlets for Decred;
- Disseminate and develop a unique story line that establishes Decred as an industry leader, innovator, and attractive project;
- Generate media placements on behalf of Decred, and continually insert its team’s commentary and thought leadership in the press, while simultaneously ‘hijacking’ industry-specific outlets with subject matter commentary;
- Educate target audiences on the importance of simple yet robust governance models.
 

**Proposed Services - PR**
Wachsman will leverage relationships with global press on behalf of Decred to disseminate news, announcements, and commentary. Wachsman will draft and distribute press releases, facilitate interviews, expand targeted media lists, and if required, engage in crisis communications that will maintain the Decred brand, secure Decred stakeholders, and protect Decred’s reputation and that of Decred’s team members.
 
In order to achieve the campaign objectives and execute the strategy for Decred, Wachsman proposes the following services:
 
**Client Consultation:** Wachsman advises a weekly phone call with the Decred team to synchronize efforts and stay abreast of current news and upcoming announcements.
 
**Content Creation:** The Wachsman team will be responsible for crafting and editing content and messaging, including internally written Decred bylines-contributed in Decred Slack/Matrix channels. Wachsman will draft press releases, media alerts, bylines, op-eds, and statements for significant company achievements, newsworthy announcements, and for crisis communications in a clear, succinct, and engaging manner. 
  
**Ongoing Media Relations:** To maintain momentum and sustain media coverage, Wachsman will leverage our access to top-tier international media and continue to build relationships with mainstream and niche media in our endeavor to generate sustained, positive press for Decred. The media relations strategy will be divided into proactive and reactive relations. Proactive media relations includes creative pitching, interviews with select business reporters, and distribution of press releases. Reactive media relations includes ‘hijacking’ daily news with expert commentary quotes from Decred team members, as well as responding to inbound queries from reporters.  
 
**Crisis Communications:** In the event of a crisis, Wachsman has a proven track record of limiting reputational impacts through a detailed damage control strategy, including when and which information to release to the public. This strategy includes holding statements, talking points, media Q&A, media engagement instructions, and time-sensitive interview preparation.
 
**Media Training:** Wachsman will provide media engagement training to prepare Decred team members for interviews and spokesperson opportunities. Training will include conducting mock interviews with spokespersons prior to media interviews. Wachsman will also prepare briefs on the publications, and reporters in advance of each engagement.


**PR and Events Deliverables**
**Communications Strategy:** Wachsman will develop a communications strategy detailing the next 30, 60, and 90 days. This strategy will outline estimated duration for key messaging and collateral development, launch plans and initiatives, event organization, media training, media targets, pitches, and other activities.
 
**Key Messaging and Brand Narrative Development:** Establish consistency of language, tone and voice of the project. Develop a narrative for Decred and highlight main points of differentiation to be used for both external and internal communications. Ensure this messaging is aligned across all touchpoints including website and social media channels.
 
**Press Release and Digital Press Kit:** Use core messaging in all communications materials and press kits, which will consist of press releases, company backgrounders, mission statements, executive summaries, biographies, FAQs, testimonials, and case studies. Wachsman will draft press releases, update existing collateral, and have it approved by Decred prior to any release.
 
**Brand Messaging Strategy Document:** Talking points to serve as a guideline for Decred spokespeople on how to best leverage key messages during speaking engagements and media interviews, which we will tailor accordingly for each interview and event.

**Events Strategy:** Wachsman will devise an events strategy with all stated objectives in mind. This will focus on brand development and driving awareness in key markets and regions globally, building awareness among potential partners, users, and key players, and continuing to position Decred as a leader within the industry. This will include the building of an event calendar with relevant conferences worldwide. Wachsman will also provide independent advice for any events that Decred is invited to engage in to ensure they are worthwhile, provide value, and are in line with business objectives.

**Events Consultation:** As part of this strategy, Wachsman will conduct research prior to sharing the events strategy, this will focus on conference topics, the caliber of attendees, speakers, and sponsors, and how Decred can leverage conference participation for maximum impact.

**Onsite Conference Management:** As part of this approach, Wachsman will liaise with all event organizers in order to secure speaking and sponsorship opportunities at conferences, negotiate rates for sponsorship packages, and contract exhibition booths and other requirements. Wachsman will negotiate and manage speaker contracts and ensure delivery of speaker topics and presentations to conference organizers. Wachsman will conduct post-event analysis to determine whether the event was worthwhile or valuable to inform future event planning. 



**Mediums by which the Decred messaging will be distributed**
**Stand-alone Feature Stories:** Potential story angles could include the impact of disruptive technologies like blockchain on the structure of organizations, and how the continuing adoption of blockchain may see a dramatic change in how we perceive organizations to be optimally structured and the values on which we base these perceptions. 
 
**Bylined Articles:** Wachsman will help to identify high-value bylined opportunities in a business or trade publications, draft content on behalf of Decred spokespeople, and deliver the pieces in a timely manner to meet editorial deadlines. Such opportunities will further position Decred executives and the company as industry authorities among target audiences.
 
**Speaking Engagements:** With a finger on the pulse of the over 700 annual cryptocurrency related conferences, panel discussions and key industry gatherings, Wachsman will develop a schedule of relevant speaking opportunities on behalf of Decred spokespeople.

**Client Satisfaction:**

The litmus test for a good PR firm is their ability to keep their client's so happy during the course of their contract that they sign to an extension past the initial contract period. Our proposal to Decred is for a six-month campaign. Here’s a list of a few of our current clients that have been at Wachsman for more than six months:

- Dash
- Lisk
- Horizen
- IOHK
- aeternity
- aelf
- Kochava
- CoinDesk
- Sharespost
- Steemit
- Coinsource
- Shyft
- Mainframe

I very much expect that at the duration of our six month campaign Decred’s stakeholders will choose to join this list.

**Campaign Duration:** Six months; from 11.01.18 — 05.01.19 (with a thirty day out clause).
