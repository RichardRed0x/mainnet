Can you provide some referral or contacts of other projects you have worked with so we can gather more feedbacks ? \n2. Personally would prefer proposals by familiar people in the decred community rather than a professional service provider. \n3. May i suggest short period of trial stage, and after gathering more feedback from teams working with you guys we can slowly extend the period of commitment. \n4. \"Decred team\" was mentioned many times in the proposal. would you list a few (3-5) personnel from the \"Decred team\" and have you discussed the proposal personally with them? Maybe we need some comments from them ?","signature":"7a43c85da8e0b7524d9585fb46f0d07fc48faf498b829398a960aeb00460db120153fd0eb5bed209e0052017d2dfb7106dcf0248348ac5fbd95d38b81451540f","publickey":"16ff7632bbe3e94e2c389a053feca8e757a4360f873643b2fe4f572908913090","commentid":"3","receipt":"3a1f1d7acc91b8ad5a29dfe22a0b7eecad8b63e72b122d296714ee828b73ef67521b6ac4b1a8bf9f29adcb9236a722868c1c4c4e3e69a30eda9a3dde7b940801","timestamp":1540072859,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

My worry is that a firm with experience dealing with other cryptocurrencies in the space will find that Decred is a horse of a different wheelbase. We don't do hype, we build. We under-promise, over-deliver. \n\n\u003e As part of the companyâ€™s narrative, Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.\n\nI'd like to know Jake's thoughts on this. In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake. I greatly trust and respect him, and I expect he will have significant influence in the project for the foreseeable future, but we're not here to make a cult of personality around him.\n\nOverall, this looks like a great pitch for promoting a company, but Decred is not a company. It's a decentralized cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso, from the diverse list of clients, it seems to indicate that Wachsman will promote nearly any project that has funding available. I totally understand why a marketing company would do that from a revenue perspective. However, I wonder if it wouldn't be more effective to have marketing people who actually are sold on DCR themselves; they HODL DCR, they stake DCR, they're perhaps even active here on Politeia. In other words, take DCR community members who have marketing experience, and pay them to market DCR more effectively.\n\nIf we would go ahead with Wachsman, I would prefer a shorter trial period before committing to six months. Or is the current proposal cancelable at any time?\n\nDisclaimer: I tend to be a pessimist by nature, so my first reaction to any proposal is usually negative. I'm not 100% opposed; I want to keep an open mind.","signature":"a351616fb7cf93d5eb41011362dc4cd126f112d908eab71d3b294219b0271622a200d11c4b2830c6cf2658161ab1dba500b9715371d56c8acbceca6e977dcb04","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"4","receipt":"f9b3b9dda5405a025d1a3ddc6b48e6eb1334bfd71f756ee0db9997143694b60a16ad3c3f465706db1356fda15b85789b7c80bf6314a2ce2b645568ad31cbcd0f","timestamp":1540075014,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
