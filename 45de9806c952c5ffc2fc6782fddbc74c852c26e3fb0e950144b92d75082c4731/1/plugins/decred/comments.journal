Now wallet is usable so you can check it out before making any decision.\n2) All coins other than BTC and ETH were a low hanging fruit that were added because tools and providers I use support those, now each extra coin would require an extra effort.\n3) Those coins did not have a voting/proposal/treasury system. I really love the idea of a community driven project and I was actually advised to post my project here to see what happens.\n\nYour concern does make a point though and that's why I tried to keep it reasonable.\n\nI would also note that if my wallet wouldn't be open sourced I wouldn't bother Decred community with this proposal. \nI think it being open sourced, multi-platform, multi-coin app is its extra value.","signature":"4dfc46ac7ead48252c492f83a8a311e8d502b6c4d0c3339bf91ad2301c1bf7f6732cead2ad140cd8e3c5c418648b7824f168b92f505ad7dc59e852b015bd0f0a","publickey":"95118e6033b2f9aa19366eb5aca78b52f0e8f9cb125fddbf8629ddab500a3dbf","commentid":"2","receipt":"444117470970f318739db07be01580c944140575eb4788eb04986cbcf62f13491289680802cb0105020836f72976ca6322c3d1da9cd8db1d49b154465681a208","timestamp":1544026726,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
