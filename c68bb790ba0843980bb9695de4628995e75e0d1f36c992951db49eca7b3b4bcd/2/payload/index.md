Decred Open Source Research

### What 

I am proposing that the Decred Treasury experiments with a small budget to fund research, with some mechanism for the community to generate and peer review research questions, and the budget being available to anyone who shows up and hacks on these questions to good effect in a certain kind of open source way.

Some of the details of how this works would be best figured out along the way. This proposal includes an initial formulation of how it could work, which I would be happy to amend in response to thoughtful community feedback.

### Why

 There are two reasons why I think this kind of program would be a good idea:

1. The Decred DAE needs to maximize its collective intelligence. The gathering and processing of information is an important function, and probably one of the harder nuts to crack.
2. From a sponsorship perspective, funding the promotion and development of data collection and analysis skills is good, because anything that allows more people to become more critical thinkers and take an evidence-based view of phenomena is good.

Basic data science hacking skills are relatively easy to learn but can be quite effective for understanding what's going on in relation to certain phenomena, especially in the realm of social media and online public discourse more generally. 

The collection and interpretation of data when faced with unknowns is a useful faculty for individuals and collectives. Open data and open source analysis work well as commons-based assets.

In a sense, this proposal is about extending the ethos around the production of Decred's software to the production of knowledge on relevant subjects. This would become another aspect of _work that Decred contributors do on the project_. 

### How

Research funded by this program would have to be open source, with all data and analysis steps or scripts being openly shared (e.g. on GitHub) and well commented so that others can repeat or tweak analyses. Participants would be encouraged to collaborate, and people who have been approved to receive payment for their work could bill for time spent reviewing or assisting others or helping them replicate something, in addition to developing their own analyses.

This principle is familiar from other aspects of Decred, where helping and being helped by others is an integral part of the work. There are also parallels with higher education, where workload is balanced between research and teaching.

As all of the work happens openly on a commons, anyone can join in with any part of it. People with rudimentary research or data analysis skills should be welcomed to join in and learn by playing around with other peoples' work.

The process of choosing research questions and developing them into actionable research projects would benefit from broad stakeholder participation - this would also help to ensure that the investigations conducted are of value to Decred.

Assuming there are some people who would like to be paid to work on this kind of task, one of the challenges will be with distributing the payments fairly. As a starting point, I propose that it works similarly to other domains of the Decred project. People show up, do some work, and can be cleared to bill their time at a set rate by an established contributor in that domain. 

**I am proposing this as an experiment**, because I think it would be interesting to provide people with:

- a set of questions deemed worthy of investigation, and maybe some ideas for how to answer them
- an environment where they can see and reproduce the work of others, and expect some degree of assistance from those others
- the incentive that if they develop their skills they can be paid for their work

More informed stakeholders are key to good decision-making, reliable and detailed information is important.

If participants produce good outputs those have the potential to be picked up by (social) media, and a credit to the Decred Treasury would present Decred in quite a positive light. 

It could also be quite beneficial for the people who participate and learn from doing so, these are good skills to have and could take people a long way.

I'm particularly interested in the method of determining the scope of the program, or what is a relevant research question to try and answer. My initial thought is to do this with a Politeia proposal that takes questions as top-level comments and uses the comment up/down voting scores as an indicator of whether Decred stakeholders see merit in them. I realize that comment scores are an imperfect indicator but I'm curious about whether the paywall to join will make them more useful. They should be less vulnerable to sybil attack than they are on reddit.

There is also a possibility of building out a small platform for organizing and presenting the work produced by this program and/or selecting and developing research questions - in the future if it looks like this is worthwhile.

I'm also curious about what kinds of research questions Decred stakeholders would want to fund work on, these could be very Decred-specific or about the cryptocurrency space or beyond. The type of questions being worked on would determine whether this is behaves more like intelligence ops for the DAE or an institution for developing commons-based knowledge as a public good. 

### Who

This would be open for anyone who wants to contribute, with individuals being cleared to bill hours against the program's budget. Initially, I would perform the role of clearing people to work on this specific program, but I would be hoping to find other people with strong and complementary skills that could assist with peer reviewing. 

### When 

I would not suggest a big budget for this initially, just enough to make things interesting and see if the idea has legs. I propose an initial budget of $10k, with the idea that this would probably cover a few months, and that by the time it's spent there would be another proposal with a more informed medium-term plan, or the idea would be dropped. 

### Further notes

This proposal is based on some of my perspectives on treasury funding (as detailed in [this blog post](https://medium.com/@richardred/on-the-launch-of-decreds-politeia-b305d06d8bda)):

- a good way to raise Decred's profile is to sponsor cool projects that wouldn't otherwise happen
- it is desirable that people encounter and think of Decred as a project they can participate in, expanding the Decred umbrella will create a broader set of opportunities for a more diverse set of potential contributors
- spending treasury funds on initiatives that lead to more informed stakeholders and a greater collective intelligence is a good idea
- projects with benefits beyond Decred, to the cryptocurrency space or society more broadly, are good

### Example research questions

I have discussed this proposal with some people and the feedback I get is that it's not clear what kind of research questions I'm thinking about. A big part of my interest here is in finding a way for the Decred community to decide which questions are worthy of investigation. I do however appreciate that it can be hard to imagine what something like this would look like without concrete examples, so here are some not very imaginative examples:

- To what extent does the governance of other cryptocurrency projects happen transparently in public spaces? Where does it happen?
- How do other cryptocurrency projects spend their Treasury/ICO/Donated funds?
- How do cryptocurrency projects use their social media accounts? What kind of messages do they produce? To what end? 
- How does the discourse within cryptocurrency communities evolve as those communities scale and respond to significant events or price volatility?

If you have ideas for examples to add to this list let me know.

### Future Development

If this proposal attracts contributors and produces good outputs, it would probably make sense to set up some sort of platform or CMS to present and coordinate work.

I have some ideas about the kind of platform that could support initiatives like this, but that's probably best kept for another proposal at another time, and in any case would benefit from seeing how this one goes.

# Addendum 1 - October 22

## A reliable approach, and an experimental approach using available tools

Some of the comments have asked for more information about exactly how this program would be run.

One of the challenges here is in finding **ways for the stakeholder community to identify the research questions or projects that merit work**. This needs a degree of Sybil resistance, because it would be funny to see nonsense questions selected for research, and so people with nothing at stake might be inclined to try and make that happen. 

I can only think of two ways to make it robust to that kind of attack:

1. An individual or group reviews the options and decides which are worthwhile/viable.
2. Use Politeia.

Option 2 sounds much more fun, so I'm inclined to try that. Option 1 sounds safe so I will do something like that in parallel. 

## The plan

**I will maintain a list of open research projects**, work on those projects can be paid for from this program's budget as long as the work is of an appropriate standard. For now, I will decide what is included in this list, but I intend to base those decisions on what the community's consensus appears to be. **I will not add projects that I see as unethical or useless to the list**, as I do not want to be responsible for reviewing that kind of work and approving payments for it.

If this proposal is approved I think it warrants a **chat channel specifically for this program**.

People who want to start working on an open research project should say so. Once they have made some progress they can ask for a review and to be considered for a Decred Contractor Clearance - I think it would make sense to limit this clearance to just the research program at first. 

Anyone who is billing for work on this program should have outputs (write-ups, charts or stats) available in their repositories, I would try to keep track of deliverables on the list too.

## Option 2

I think it would be fun to try using Politeia for this, and we may well learn something along the way. 

Full on Politeia proposal votes are not appropriate, at least with the way things are currently set up. A proposal would be required for each research project, which could involve quite a few proposals. These would clutter up the interface of both [proposals.decred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/) and the voting interface in Decrediton, and probably cause a degree of voter fatigue.

Comments and up/down votes on [proposals.decred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/) are sheltered from Sybil attacks to some degree because there is a registration fee which must be paid in DCR. 

If this proposal is approved, I intend to try using a **Politeia proposal as a space for discussing and approving research questions and methodologies**.

Top-level comments should be research questions or objectives. Second-level replies to those comments should be methodologies for addressing the research question. Splitting these up allows people to propose a question or task without having to propose a methodology. It would be fine for people to propose both a question and methodology for answering their own question.

A target score would be set, let's say **5**. If the question (level 1) and methodology (level 2 child) both have a score of at least **5**, then that's a signal from Politeia users that the approach is worth trying and time spent should be billable.

I would keep a list of open research projects in the proposal body, along with the current target score. If a proposal (tier 1) and a plan (tier 2) both have the target score I will add it to the list, *unless I think it's bad*.

The people who are running open research projects should start repositories for storing their data/scripts/graphs/write-ups. 

I will probably add some of my own research project ideas as a starting point, but I would prefer this proposal to engage the Decred community in shaping the project's research agenda.

### Problems with taking this approach right now

There are a number of problems with using Politeia for this as things stand. 

The lack of an edit or delete option for comments is likely to be problematic. It is using the system in a way it wasn't really designed for, which is likely to get messy. People will make mistakes with where they put things, and there will be no way to fix those except ask an administrator to delete them.

Comment voting could be manipulated, and although there would be a cost to doing so (0.1 DCR per account) it would not be expensive at this stage to buy enough accounts to exert significant influence on the comment scores. If a proposal for something funny like an Antarctic survey gets up-voted I will ignore that vote and do something else instead (the Boaty McBoatface solution).

Although the setup is less than ideal, I think there's enough to be learned from experimenting with the tools that Politeia offers  to make option 2 worth a try.

## Some clarifications

I don't intend to spend a lot of my time doing research on this program. The next few months will be quite busy for me, so I will likely contribute to this program initially by coordinating, reviewing, helping out in general, and a few hours of research here and there. 

With this proposal I am more interested in emboldening other people to take on research for Decred, and to participate in setting the agenda for that research. 

I intend to continue with the various other types of work I do for Decred regardless of this proposal's success or failure.
