Walkthrough videos are great for helping people feel comfortable operating software. Having made such software walkthrough videos myself, for other projects, I think your compensation amount is reasonable.  I have an issue with the order in which you propose to cover the subjects. Jumping into Politeia for video #2 is a bit too deep too soon for people just getting their feet wet. I would like to see staking and voting come in at #2. Tutorial #3 could then be a deeper dive into becoming active in the Politeia process.  I don't think  we need a tutorial on making a Politeia proposal. People who are ready to write Politeia proposals probably don't need a software walkthrough.","signature":"84572795db60bf259d80c07b6823c4ca4b3eadafbbc4d196e77801f6e77578256d2ba3218b8601f205c1c7fb20b1e47157dd46a7f930df679d7553545e9aa70d","publickey":"1fab00e1b8f990ad9a16fcdb932462118bb506311f86a32717913d9b088eee11","commentid":"1","receipt":"121ce0eb8532e5c839118474392aa50821938bdafab8b5622ba71f79620ae91974163ce5cfcf4be01bae4cfb2ca5539b71bbd5cd8f7268de9de77b461504080a","timestamp":1550605124,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I’ve changed the order of the videos to your liking. Video #2 will be about Staking and Voting. And Video #3 will be about diving deeper into Politeia. \n \nTo be clear about the content in Video #4, my intention for this video is to include the software walkthrough and also discuss other specifics including: guidelines for putting together a proposal, discussing it on Slack, posting it on Reddit, editing proposal based off feedback, finalizing proposal and submitting it, and getting community support.\n \nAs a user, I’d like to see this content be included. I decided to add it to Video #3 as part of the deep dive into Politeia/ being active in the Politeia process. If you think this content deserves a separate video, let me know so I can change it. However, I think it will fit fine in Video #3.","signature":"9c24323d007feaddc12218b34b334f432c952f77415234e78da3567ffbec044b6cb7a28f7e02a15ef6d14634d7e95d93d721acf2be82a94192ecfe103d0fe50b","publickey":"cd71155ab0f7944118e8a9ed46bdde77d4724f61f2c9ebffaf898308f0185b92","commentid":"2","receipt":"c2288fed6f376e09abb215ff8c955cd5528fc40fb45bc9ec7002e0d68372c9a90acd0839745b99af9a0962baca131011b9e5592d2ad7fe08e6a84496022fe101","timestamp":1550618012,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
