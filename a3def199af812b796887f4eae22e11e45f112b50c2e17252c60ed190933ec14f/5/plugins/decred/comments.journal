Walkthrough videos are great for helping people feel comfortable operating software. Having made such software walkthrough videos myself, for other projects, I think your compensation amount is reasonable.  I have an issue with the order in which you propose to cover the subjects. Jumping into Politeia for video #2 is a bit too deep too soon for people just getting their feet wet. I would like to see staking and voting come in at #2. Tutorial #3 could then be a deeper dive into becoming active in the Politeia process.  I don't think  we need a tutorial on making a Politeia proposal. People who are ready to write Politeia proposals probably don't need a software walkthrough.","signature":"84572795db60bf259d80c07b6823c4ca4b3eadafbbc4d196e77801f6e77578256d2ba3218b8601f205c1c7fb20b1e47157dd46a7f930df679d7553545e9aa70d","publickey":"1fab00e1b8f990ad9a16fcdb932462118bb506311f86a32717913d9b088eee11","commentid":"1","receipt":"121ce0eb8532e5c839118474392aa50821938bdafab8b5622ba71f79620ae91974163ce5cfcf4be01bae4cfb2ca5539b71bbd5cd8f7268de9de77b461504080a","timestamp":1550605124,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
