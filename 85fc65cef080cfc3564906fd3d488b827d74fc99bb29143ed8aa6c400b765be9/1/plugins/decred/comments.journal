The treasury isn't meant as a bank from which to fund your personal ventures, business ideas or experimentation. If you are to convince stakeholders to approve your proposal **you will need to demonstrate clearly how it would benefit the project** and not your business. I'm sure at some point stakeholders may be inclined to take some risks on innovative ideas that have clear potential benefits but maybe for now, it would be best to **consider stakeholders as being very conservative and careful in their spending**.\n\n2. **Technical words have specific meanings.** If someone doesn't grasp the meanings and concepts behind those words and attempts to use them in an amalgam of tasty selling points on a checklist, it will fail miserably. The Decred community is composed of  extremely talented devs who have been in the space for years, hardcore fans who take to heart to stay informed, and stakeholders who have money at stakes, which means for them, making the best decision is paramount. If you want to bring meaningful words like \"decentralized\" to the discussion, you better make sure you understand what it means and what are the implications of these terms in the context of your proposal.\n\n3. Being a technical community; claims of profit, market valuations/predictions, investment models, and general claims of \"future popular trends in cryptos\", will most likely be seen as vaporware and distractions. The main selling point of a proposal for building software in this project should probably **focus primarily on the direct improvement to the project** you expect, and on precisely how it will be implemented on a technical level.\n\n4. The community will vote! If you do not engage with the community prior to posting a proposal, you do not gather ideas, and advice, you do not verify basic support and interest beforehand, you are deliberately reducing immensely your chances of seeing your proposal go through. To take a bad example: **Don't be that politician, whose name you see for the first time, on a ballot.**\n\n5. Words are not enough to prove your capability. **The bigger the proposal, the more you will need to convince stakeholders you are capable of doing what you say.** Decred being open-source, show past contributions to this or other projects (emphasis on verifiable source-code). If you want to work with current devs, actually work with them and make sure you can get the DCC (Decred Contract clearance) and simply get along with other contractors in the project. It's sad but not everybody is cut-out for open-source and blockchain development. Ultimately, **you cannot expect stakeholders to blindly take a leap of faith** that everything will \"work out\".\n\n\nAs a summary, if you want to contribute, maybe taking the project as an example would be a good start. You are more likely to gain support by underselling/over-delivering. Technical accuracy is mandatory. Put forth smaller, solid blocks to build foundations within this community, rather than showing a castle of cards.","signature":"7810b868694f2e9017183bf9e975658e0e633818c566c84455c6b35ad53e7c22e527bc0832e5d693725743848d47a73f90df511843c098728f455c8540e29b05","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"2","receipt":"cd6a23f00fdb9ea66daee6f4cee7418800202596dc8f1d437ed536392dc62d79cdb1505f2c639d94f077aea35c0e23f2438f417c5e2f81a1f59888259a532c04","timestamp":1543987139,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
