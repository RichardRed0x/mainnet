# What

**USDD stable coin**

**The joint company - between REUM and Moentum have created a USD-backed token.**

**USDD** - is a stable coin built as the currency which can be purchased with crypto (all established exchange coins) or fiat (debit card or bank transfer) by users, **REUM** seeks funding to complete the stable coin GUI, which allows users to purchase stable coins to be backed by **Decred (DCR)** as remeedable upon the USD value, each USD is pegged 1:1 to each **USDD**. 

# Why

Our in-house studies has revealed stable coins as the main cryptocurrency technology for us to concentrate our efforts on in 2019 and our external online research referencing to a report, entitled the **Cryptoasset Market Coverage**.

Outlining a number of predictions for the virtual currency markets. 

*The report assets that over 90 percent of “cryptoasset value will be derived from penetration of offshore deposits in the next decade” and it anticipates that such a state will propel the market capitalization of all cryptocurrency markets, according to* **Satis Crypto Market Predictions:** 

**$500 Billion** in 2019, **$1 Trillion** by 2021 and **$3.57 trillion** by 2028, while 90% of crypto currency asset value will be extracted from penetration of offshore deposits in the next ten years, stable currency is about to dominate the development conversations around digital currency over the next year.*

All **USDD** on exchanges will be backed 1:1 with **Decred (DCR)** and valued pegged at USD, providing an obvious route to 'in-house' digitally implemented store of value provision for **DCR**, during harsh market periods and the peg will allow **Decred** to become part of the new securities market emerging within cryptocurrency. **USDD** with merge the **Decrediton GUI** for the USDD stable coin wallet solution.

**USDD** is redeemable for USD, simply by entering your wallet address into the **USDD portal** and upload your USDD currency to get conversion back to fiat or to DCR, any verified account that passes the USDD industry standard KYC/AML check is legally entitled to redeem **USDD** for USD.

# How

**Decred** will provide **USDD** with an immediate paid up collateral model for the asset backed element of stable coins – it is a hybrid model based on a simple mathematical formula 1:1 to 1:1 pegs for value and asset.

- asset backed by **DCR**
- value backed by USD

Every **USDD** is always fully collateralised by paid up capital as value pegged to USD and asset tethered to **Decred (DCR)* in the unique use from the standard stable to fiat coin model, our stable coin uses DCR to keep the currency true, and pegged to USD to allow simple trade calculations, profits are created by arbitrage from payments, but also from **USDD** trade, which brings further revenue while we assist as the blockchain layer of bank services.

**Decred Politeia** funding will provide new developments related to algorithmic stability, AI/ML and KYC embedded into the smart contract and the currency directly (meaning each coin/token has a separate ID, bank friendly and regulation proof currency), also traditional market solutions for mortgages, cross border payments, remittance, escrow and clearing services.

**USDD** is a secure and regulatory friendly transaction framework, which has performed R&D related to stable coins and has partnerships, trade relations as connected to institutional investors into this network to purchase or redeem **USDD.**
