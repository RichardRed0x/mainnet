The treasury isn't meant as a bank from which to fund your personal ventures, business ideas or experimentation. If you are to convince stakeholders to approve your proposal **you will need to demonstrate clearly how it would benefit the project** and not your business. I'm sure at some point stakeholders may be inclined to take some risks on innovative ideas that have clear potential benefits but maybe for now, it would be best to **consider stakeholders as being very conservative and careful in their spending**.\n\n2. **Technical words have specific meanings.** If someone doesn't grasp the meanings and concepts behind those words and attempts to use them in an amalgam of tasty selling points on a checklist, it will fail miserably. The Decred community is composed of  extremely talented devs who have been in the space for years, hardcore fans who take to heart to stay informed, and stakeholders who have money at stakes, which means for them, making the best decision is paramount. If you want to bring meaningful words like \"decentralized\" to the discussion, you better make sure you understand what it means and what are the implications of these terms in the context of your proposal.\n\n3. Being a technical community; claims of profit, market valuations/predictions, investment models, and general claims of \"future popular trends in cryptos\", will most likely be seen as vaporware and distractions. The main selling point of a proposal for building software in this project should probably **focus primarily on the direct improvement to the project** you expect, and on precisely how it will be implemented on a technical level.\n\n4. The community will vote! If you do not engage with the community prior to posting a proposal, you do not gather ideas, and advice, you do not verify basic support and interest beforehand, you are deliberately reducing immensely your chances of seeing your proposal go through. To take a bad example: **Don't be that politician, whose name you see for the first time, on a ballot.**\n\n5. Words are not enough to prove your capability. **The bigger the proposal, the more you will need to convince stakeholders you are capable of doing what you say.** Decred being open-source, show past contributions to this or other projects (emphasis on verifiable source-code). If you want to work with current devs, actually work with them and make sure you can get the DCC (Decred Contract clearance) and simply get along with other contractors in the project. It's sad but not everybody is cut-out for open-source and blockchain development. Ultimately, **you cannot expect stakeholders to blindly take a leap of faith** that everything will \"work out\".\n\n\nAs a summary, if you want to contribute, maybe taking the project as an example would be a good start. You are more likely to gain support by underselling/over-delivering. Technical accuracy is mandatory. Put forth smaller, solid blocks to build foundations within this community, rather than showing a castle of cards.","signature":"7810b868694f2e9017183bf9e975658e0e633818c566c84455c6b35ad53e7c22e527bc0832e5d693725743848d47a73f90df511843c098728f455c8540e29b05","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"2","receipt":"cd6a23f00fdb9ea66daee6f4cee7418800202596dc8f1d437ed536392dc62d79cdb1505f2c639d94f077aea35c0e23f2438f417c5e2f81a1f59888259a532c04","timestamp":1543987139,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If you're just looking for a short response to this proposal, just read his comment and stop reading mine; it's long.\n\nSeemed easiest just to quote the entire proposal with my comments inserted; here goes:\n\u003e # What\n\u003e \n\u003e **USDD stable coin**\n\u003e \n\u003e **The joint company - between REUM and Moentum have created a USD-backed token.**\n\nTo be clear, has this token already been created? If so, links please?\n\n\u003e \n\u003e **USDD** - is a stable coin built as the currency which can be purchased with crypto (all established exchange coins) or fiat (debit card or bank transfer) by users, **REUM** seeks funding to complete the stable coin GUI, which allows users to purchase stable coins to be backed by **Decred (DCR)** as remeedable upon the USD value, each USD is pegged 1:1 to each **USDD**. \n\nSo is REUM starting an exchange to allow the purchase of USDD, that's going to support \"all established exchange coins\" \u0026 fiat? Is the development required for that included in this proposal, or is that separate? Or is this promise contingent on [Decredex](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e78bc28631d0e682912e3ece25944481bf978b906ea44b1ed36470c0f48b27fc) being funded?\n\nAlso, let me get this straight: USDD is backed by DCR, but pegged to USD, am I right? What happens if the USD value of the DCR backing USDD goes down; how is the peg retained? Also, who holds the DCR used for backing USDD?\n\n\u003e # Why\n\u003e \n\u003e Our in-house studies has revealed stable coins as the main cryptocurrency technology for us to concentrate our efforts on in 2019 and our external online research referencing to a report, entitled the **Cryptoasset Market Coverage**.\n\u003e \n\u003e Outlining a number of predictions for the virtual currency markets. \n\u003e\n\u003e *The report assets that over 90 percent of “cryptoasset value will be derived from penetration of offshore deposits in the next decade” and it anticipates that such a state will propel the market capitalization of all cryptocurrency markets, according to* **Satis Crypto Market Predictions:** \n\u003e \n\u003e **$500 Billion** in 2019, **$1 Trillion** by 2021 and **$3.57 trillion** by 2028, while 90% of crypto currency asset value will be extracted from penetration of offshore deposits in the next ten years, stable currency is about to dominate the development conversations around digital currency over the next year.*\n\nOK, I get it, a lot of people think stable coins are the next big thing. There are already quite a few: Tether, Dai, TrueUSD, USD Coin, Paxos, and I'm sure I missed several. How will USDD be better than these existing solutions? In other words, why yet another stable coin? What's wrong with the existing coins that USDD solves?\n\n\u003e All **USDD** on exchanges will be backed 1:1 with **Decred (DCR)** and valued pegged at USD, providing an obvious route to 'in-house' digitally implemented store of value provision for **DCR**, during harsh market periods and the peg will allow **Decred** to become part of the new securities market emerging within cryptocurrency. **USDD** with merge the **Decrediton GUI** for the USDD stable coin wallet solution.\n\nAgain, still haven't explained how that peg holds when DCR goes down in value.\n\nAlso, you're proposing making changes to Dcredition, which will certainly require a [Decred Contractor Clearance](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4). Has anyone from your company obtained a DCC? If so, please list those individuals.\n \n\u003e **USDD** is redeemable for USD, simply by entering your wallet address into the **USDD portal** and upload your USDD currency to get conversion back to fiat or to DCR, any verified account that passes the USDD industry standard KYC/AML check is legally entitled to redeem **USDD** for USD.\n\nWho will be running the USDD portal and enforcing the KYC/AML standards?\n\n\u003e # How\n\u003e \n\u003e **Decred** will provide **USDD** with an immediate paid up collateral model for the asset backed element of stable coins – it is a hybrid model based on a simple mathematical formula 1:1 to 1:1 pegs for value and asset.\n\u003e \n\u003e - asset backed by **DCR**\n\u003e - value backed by USD\n\u003e \n\u003e Every **USDD** is always fully collateralised by paid up capital as value pegged to USD and asset tethered to **Decred (DCR)* in the unique use from the standard stable to fiat coin model, our stable coin uses DCR to keep the currency true, and pegged to USD to allow simple trade calculations, profits are created by arbitrage from payments, but also from **USDD** trade, which brings further revenue while we assist as the blockchain layer of bank services.\n\nYou mentioned profits; who makes the profits? REUM or the Decred Treasury?\n\nStill waiting to hear a clear explanation of how this peg really works.\n\n\u003e **Decred Politeia** funding will provide new developments related to algorithmic stability, AI/ML and KYC embedded into the smart contract and the currency directly (meaning each coin/token has a separate ID, bank friendly and regulation proof currency), also traditional market solutions for mortgages, cross border payments, remittance, escrow and clearing services.\n\nDecred does not have turing-complete smart contracts; only simple Bitcoin-like script. How in the world are you going to do KYC with bitcoin-like script?\n\n\"regulation proof currency\" What does that even mean?\n\nDCR already works fine for cross-border payments; and escrow is already possible with 2-of-3 multisig. Why reinvent the wheel?\n\n\u003e **USDD** is a secure and regulatory friendly transaction framework, which has performed R\u0026D related to stable coins and has partnerships, trade relations as connected to institutional investors into this network to purchase or redeem **USDD.**\n\u003e \n\u003e # Who\n\u003e \n\u003e **USDD** is a stable coin created by **REUM Ltd** and **Spot Quote LLC** trading as **Moentum**, two companies connected by **Fabian Jean-Baptiste**, he is CEO at **REUM Ltd** based in London, UK\n \nSpot Quote LLC doesn't seem to be doing very well financially; the financial report for the year 2017 indicates a **loss of $2,993 USD**. Doesn't seem like a very successful company. (Since this is an SEC-regulated company, financial reports are public; source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/1800/18007859.pdf)\n\n\u003e **Head of Europe for Moentum a start up with SEC Approval and Finra registration.**\n\u003e \n\u003e **Fabian** has valuable experience and can project manage the stable coin division for USDD, with vital previous knowledge from working with Bank Token, he has ethical access to IP and to talented fintech development teams in London, **Fabian** has the respect of many blockchain companies, including Moentum who have an impressive addition to his REUM service and as part of his portfolio of related fintech services.\n\u003e\n\u003e **Bank Token** is a project manager at this project, who will provide the technology for the USDD stable coin, as pegged to Decred **DCR** with **Politeia** funding, **Fabian** will establish a office and an SME data centre (co-location) in London, UK and to house a development team and secure servers as foundational elements of the stable coin business, which will eventually boast its own fintech cloud service by Q3 2019. \n\nFirst off, this Bank Token. Bank Token has a webpage, but isn't listed on CoinMarketCap; has it launched yet? Also, the Telegram group has a total of 9 members, and is basically a ghost town (mostly posts from Fabian). Not what I'd call a success. Why will USDD not suffer the same fate?\n\nWhy do you need a location to house a development team? What's wrong with a remote team? And also, what's this fintech cloud service about?","signature":"6cb79467c822387922f9ca0e1a1424c9b6730ad771ff26956b49ef640f7bdb688a435a45c37ad49f857733af67fc901dd7018affe076d447dc14c23babf4dc0d","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"7","receipt":"351a365b523f235f8e3d62866bdcf12bca22dcd790a59c5677483c3e4d893e4252654ef63584e846228cb362339f2f4f00f64779ecbb214e58ac2d0a1352fa0d","timestamp":1544051220,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
