Website for the Decred community
## What
Right now, the Decred community is scattered across the web. Multiple platforms and language barriers make it difficult to scale Decred to a global level. I am proposing to create an online home for the Decred community. I have created a prototype of the website at: https://decredcommunity.com 

The core idea of this new website:

- Aggregate content from different platforms (blogs, medium, podcasts, videos).
- Sections: Articles (but not limited to: Pi Digest, Medium articles written by contributors, Decred Journal), Videos,  Podcasts, Events Calendar, Photogallery and Conference Reports
- Offer anyone the opportunity to publish their Decred related articles and translations.
- Mirror essential services (dcrdata, dcrdocs, hardforkdemo and testnetpool).


## Why
A strong community is indispensable for a healthy digital currency. Some even say it is the most important characteristic. However, the web is a big place. With so many different platforms and media, it can be hard to keep up with the latest Decred news. Not every community member has the time to read content from different sources. In the last months, the Decred Journal has done a great job accumulating content from different sources. A community website that aggregates all this content will reduce the time for people to stay up-to-date.

We frequently receive request to publish a list of merchants accepting DCR. Another thing that is currently missing from our community is a calendar with Decred events. Both of these will be added as a section to the new website.

Some people would like to read our content in their own language. However, we don't pay for any community translations and getting content translated via agencies is often expensive and slow. We propose to work with local community leaders such as Emilio Mann for Brazil, DZ for Russia, and Kozel for Poland, in order to get fast and high quality translations of the most important content. 

## Current features
The lionshare of work is done. Following features are enabled:

- Sections for Articles, Podcasts, Events and Merchants
- Free text search functionality
- Content tagging for people/names, categories and topics
- Nightmode view
- Magazine overview https://decredcommunity.com/magazine

## Under construction
As mentioned, the prototype of the website is already complete. I have drafted a timeline for the next few weeks of work that I will do with support from the treasury.

- Page optimizations (Speed, LazyLoad Intersection Observer, js cleanups)
- Add multilanguage support (and add allready translated articles)
- Adding articles written by Decred contributors (until today)
- Photo gallery (public + private)
- password protected private Areas for press/investor material
- Newsletter service (multiple topics selections, coordinated with the marketing team)
- Mirrors of dcrdata, dcrdocs, hardforkdemo, testnet vsp available under <subdomain>.decredcommunity.com

## Costs
I have been building the prototype in my own time, and now i feel ready to make the next steps. With approval of the community, i will continue to improve the website add further features as mentioned in the 'under construction' section of this proposal. Further suggestions by the community are welcome.

**Initial Cost:**
**$6000**

**Monthly:** **$100.00 server** + 
**workhours x $35.00**
(min. 5 hours, max $700 hardcap)


### Initial creation costs
I propose an initial payment of **$6000** to cover the costs of building the prototype.

### Ongoing budget
Ongoing budget = infrastructure costs + operational costs

I propose an ongoing capped budget of **max $700.00** per month. This should cover at least ~30 workhours per month. I will only bill for the hours effectively used, and i will create task reports to make the workhours transparent. Hourly-wages set to **$35.00**. I expect 15 hours per month enough for adding new published contents, managing server and incoming communications. When i need additional budget, i will submit a new proposal to indicate the changes i would like to make. The provided Server is a bare-metal XEON 32GB, 2TB, IP subnet, located in Helsinki at a monthly cost of **$100.00**. Other Decred infrastructure elements will be hosted on that server (dcrdata, dcrstakepool testnet, dcrdocs, testnetfaucet, hardforkdemo).

This proposal covers an ongoing budget for the first 6 months.  A new proposal will need to be submitted after that, or for any new budgetary items beyond the scope of this proposal.

## Who 
The prototype was built by karamble. I will continue to build out the website and fill it with content and grant access to backends for other contributors based on my selection.

The back-end of the website is running a content management system that makes it easy for non-technical people to join. Backend roles can configured granularly, for seperate authors, editors, publishers and translators.

## Notable Changes
* Reduced the amount of minimum hours per month from 10 to 5 hours.
* Added example sections that will covered in the articles section
* Reduced the budget for the ongoing monthly budget to 20 hours max. ($700,00)
* Newsletter effords will be coordinated with the  marketing team
