I have looked at the page.... a \"must have\" for Decred! Perfect structure, good clarity, unlimited info! Incredible preliminary work. I am really thrilled. And to be honest, $ 6,000 is a gift! Running costs of 30 hours a month is realistic for me and above all \"honest\" and fair. And that is very important for me personally!
