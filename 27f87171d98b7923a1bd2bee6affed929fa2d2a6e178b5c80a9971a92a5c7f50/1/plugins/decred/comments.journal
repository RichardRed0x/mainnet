I ask because the proposal represents a substantial commitment from both parties. Would there be value in scaling up the services in lieu of $30k out of the gate to ensure it's an appropriate fit? Something like starting around $10k and incrementing up by $5k/mo until the services provided are sufficient for the network needs. I also think this proposal would be better received by stakeholders if it included a shorter out clause, something like 30 days.","signature":"db77645a6790e1ddf4f915b9efcf2b636b410e82e5fb0edb316d0e658e352a506cd5dc6afbef855850ae75bc9a908337572fdd25271d9b753c2a65bfcb783301","publickey":"dbc137c9276d6f5a3dcc3422406d15cb07b3036f57308a3c6bca90648e3577ab","commentid":"1","receipt":"632a3ac6d4edeb4bc1e22446d83a2f033b19da410b9299ef5c9a848b5f329cad52a06dde5be49d3e8e435f0dce432be5849651a3dfed247bbb2c22ec6ca1310b","timestamp":1540166409,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Our treasury is backed entirely by DCR. As such, a proposal requiring payment in USD is problematic for a number of reasons.\n\n1. It displays a lack of confidence in the project on the part of the firm making the proposal.\n2. It requires the use of an intermediary to accept DCR and then convert it to USD so payment can be made.\n3. It negates our ability to create an ecosystem in which Decred is used as a currency, and in the ideal scenario, our contractors potentially become stakeholders.\n\nI also find the stipulation requiring 90 days of notice for termination to be a huge red flag. Exposing the project to an additional $90K USD of costs in the event we see a need to terminate the relationship is unwarranted, to say the least.","signature":"e1e5f8490e2a78ef2087803c53ca4b61b72b45eea14e87708c201133b4c3d3d9ffb65ec524b31370234d86ce15fb528d41dcea6fb4ddf554fa532c4a2bdbfa0a","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"3","receipt":"7d260df729111a1d73685fa76633077f38320971de6198df9d1270a747bd1045a7565a53a132e8722fb43147b1187b669b4218d6c6dcc8bcd09678fc92212201","timestamp":1540192706,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
