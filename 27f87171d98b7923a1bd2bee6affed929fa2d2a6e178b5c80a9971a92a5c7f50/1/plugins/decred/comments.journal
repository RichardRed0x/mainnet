I ask because the proposal represents a substantial commitment from both parties. Would there be value in scaling up the services in lieu of $30k out of the gate to ensure it's an appropriate fit? Something like starting around $10k and incrementing up by $5k/mo until the services provided are sufficient for the network needs. I also think this proposal would be better received by stakeholders if it included a shorter out clause, something like 30 days.","signature":"db77645a6790e1ddf4f915b9efcf2b636b410e82e5fb0edb316d0e658e352a506cd5dc6afbef855850ae75bc9a908337572fdd25271d9b753c2a65bfcb783301","publickey":"dbc137c9276d6f5a3dcc3422406d15cb07b3036f57308a3c6bca90648e3577ab","commentid":"1","receipt":"632a3ac6d4edeb4bc1e22446d83a2f033b19da410b9299ef5c9a848b5f329cad52a06dde5be49d3e8e435f0dce432be5849651a3dfed247bbb2c22ec6ca1310b","timestamp":1540166409,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Our treasury is backed entirely by DCR. As such, a proposal requiring payment in USD is problematic for a number of reasons.\n\n1. It displays a lack of confidence in the project on the part of the firm making the proposal.\n2. It requires the use of an intermediary to accept DCR and then convert it to USD so payment can be made.\n3. It negates our ability to create an ecosystem in which Decred is used as a currency, and in the ideal scenario, our contractors potentially become stakeholders.\n\nI also find the stipulation requiring 90 days of notice for termination to be a huge red flag. Exposing the project to an additional $90K USD of costs in the event we see a need to terminate the relationship is unwarranted, to say the least.","signature":"e1e5f8490e2a78ef2087803c53ca4b61b72b45eea14e87708c201133b4c3d3d9ffb65ec524b31370234d86ce15fb528d41dcea6fb4ddf554fa532c4a2bdbfa0a","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"3","receipt":"7d260df729111a1d73685fa76633077f38320971de6198df9d1270a747bd1045a7565a53a132e8722fb43147b1187b669b4218d6c6dcc8bcd09678fc92212201","timestamp":1540192706,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think the Decred marketing team is doing a good job with the selection of events we appear at. Mind you, though your team can point to numerous events and conferences in the crypto space does not mean that their profiles necessarily aligns with Decred's goals, e.g. attending buzzwordy conferences with 95% ICO in attendance.\n2. An apparent no prior interest in Decred and disbursement of 2/3rds of monthly funds for the campaign in fiat does highlight a lack of belief in the success of the project; the 1/3rd payable in DCR being a \"safe\" investment for when/if it makes it big.\n3. 3 months of termination notice is just a dealbreaker for me.","signature":"942f218e48e5d68d7271c305205f414e2a84c6b4567dd25c85a524f3202ca03f89556278eb4c29f5f634102c77ca5ddad9ef79dcd15eb4ab75e293c417229d05","publickey":"3f5d5b555251e70ca8ae1c1c2ef5f03797c21f06dba38071d52a5167347ad7d7","commentid":"4","receipt":"2ad452312bca3f7c1421208b78d8bf8c1868be2c57be7f97a9857c115709c46c3ed43172ed341a7272a6a474bf6d21e71d521dc1b6f3a3165791d595e79d190b","timestamp":1540201954,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We did help rewrite the Politea press release, which resulted from several productive conversations with multiple Decred members over the past few weeks. You can see the final result [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181016005342/en/Decred-Launches-Politeia-Self-Governance-System-Release-20-Million).\n\nImportantly, Ditto was founded on “introductory retainers,” which means proving ourselves and growing. From what we understand, though, there’s a lot of work to be done. We are firm believers in only proposing what a client truly needs (and what we know we can succeed at). And sometimes that means doing one thing really well and growing from there.\n\nSix months is a pretty standard length for a PR campaign — it’s what you’ll encounter with just about any firm you work with. We do offer a 90 day termination clause, meaning if we don’t do what we said we would do in the first 90 days, you have every right to fire us. Honestly, no one has ever utilized that clause.\n\nOne more point about our prior experience. We have worked with many serious projects with a long-term roadmap — everyone from Monero to Augur to Chronicled to Origin to Kadena to CoinList – the list goes on. We are a PR firm that has proven itself in the past two years as a team that knows blockchain.\n\nAlso, we pride ourselves on being capable of handling as much of the work as possible. Other PR firms definitely aren’t like that. We will request a thorough onboarding and be true partners moving forward, meaning we will be doing most of the work. Our ability to do this is because we deeply understand blockchain and Decred’s value more than your typical PR firm.","signature":"f44334ca5e6cc11c6933562eb3f63b7df7a5c7687179296e0ef21c0dd29f7367bb26b6630ab2be6304f6de51cddd92373ea8066637f16a959fc19457565bd006","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"7","receipt":"09a645f267511d55f1ec94f408a0ead1906f1b6b6e9d294751375b8a21899062d471bda5aef44941d3fc3e9b2b89f57ca7288667169444e0ecdab5324b9e740d","timestamp":1540249309,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If DCR suffers a catastrophic event that puts the price into a significant downturn, you're stuck with a contract to fulfill, accepting money that's loosing value every day.

We're trying to build a trustless decentralized system with Politiea, and that excludes the possibility of trusting a central entity to exchange your payment to USD.\n\nI am paid 100% in BTC at my job, but I have expenses, taxes, etc. and nearly all of them are paid in USD. It's _my_ job to exchange the BTC I earn to USD as needed. You can do the same.","signature":"b79b0596d7e695296d17275af585e874342da3e68aa13daa6131d7463e2fc74830361a6be805d2df382736876624695c56e3a0ced1acdb147cb23ee5893a5309","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"19","receipt":"5b1033be8393dcacaf2e13533f19b21e0e181d85f5cb5ba91d52f39d58e41f348d2f591c9618ae78c28044ee5f82d9aaa7212d5317aefdfb0409b5dfd6200009","timestamp":1540308344,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The majority of our clients are startups, so we understand how valuable time is.\n\nOne of the things I’ve noticed when companies meet with us is they say, “You know, our last PR firm had good ideas but it just translated to more work for us. And we don’t have time to do all that.” We pride ourselves in making sure Ditto does all the heavy lifting. Doesn’t mean we won’t need some of your valuable time. But it’s also why we are considered the “anti PR Agency.” We do things the right way, which isn’t how other PR firms do it.\n\nA good PR plan actually takes time OFF your schedule. If we create a smart plan, prioritize, etc., Ditto can then execute without having to bother you too much. I’d argue a good PR plan maximizes the time you have – not add on more time. And it’s why we don’t charge by the hour, like most PR firms. We’d much rather get BIG results in less time than the opposite of that.\n\nBacking up a little more, we work with developers ranging from coding bootcamps to founders to blockchain companies. So, we understand how to work with devs. Also, we are a new source for your community. A dev may have a question about something PR related, and Ditto is 24/7 on demand to answer any and everything.\n\nFinally, Ditto has succeeded and grown over the years based on one simple reason: we are results focused. It’s right in our little motto: Strategy, execution, results.","signature":"b54e9c04f7c1c3e71f3252517f4d87942f0295bf831d2daa601584554b131e67c123b7588588c4da3251e132abcb89ad562b0a8f6bfefe868ab1000e3ef02f0a","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"21","receipt":"3eb09e121297d4863393131a41fcecf2201fcca6b066039198a9efaf9d2434434f5f03404010717cb7ed5b0057460937ef0c83675d00a0fc3a9c2b0871978808","timestamp":1540323384,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
