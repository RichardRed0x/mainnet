Ditto Communications Proposal for Decred
**What**

We are proposing a PR campaign aimed at raising awareness and adoption for Decred. This will entail actively engaging and working with the Decred community to develop targeted and newsworthy content, raising your visibility and elevating your brand through strategic media placements and speaking engagements, and better defining your value proposition to externally facing audiences. 

This proposal includes a broad outline of how a 6-month PR campaign would be structured. We are happy to clarify any questions in response to the community’s feedback.

**Why**

There are 3 reasons we believe Decred would benefit from a dedicated PR campaign and why [Ditto](https://www.dittopr.co/) is the best partner for Decred: 

1. Nobody in the blockchain space has figured out truly decentralized governance yet — until now. Decred is better equipped than anyone to educate both a technical and a mainstream audience on what governance is, why it matters both within and without the blockchain space, and how to properly execute it. But Decred needs the appropriate communications tools to effectively initiate and manage that conversation.

2. Ditto is a team of crypto and blockchain experts, and we have a deep and nuanced understanding of governance — a topic of central importance to Decred. But we also understand the broader ecosystem and have worked on issues surrounding scalability and mainstream adoption. We work with a range of blockchain/crypto projects, including (but not limited to) CoinList, Monero, Augur, Tari, Kadena, SFOX, Origin, Omega One, Current, and Urbit. We give guidance and counsel on a regular basis, and most critically, we deliver impactful results.

3. We believe that with the right message and strategic approach, Decred can garner more impactful media attention in a way that directly aligns with your project’s objectives and mission.

**How**

We have identified 8 interconnected tactics to meet Decred’s communications objectives: 

**1. Refine positioning, messaging, and talking points**

What you say about Decred and how you say it makes a difference. Ditto believes that every successful communications campaign begins with the development of a smart, compelling, and strategic messaging platform.

Ditto is also strategic about where we place our clients, how they are positioned, and what they say. In order for your messaging to resonate, it must be targeted to specific audiences and communicated in a way that is easily digested.   

For Decred, we see maintaining active and robust communications with the community as paramount. That said, it is even more critical than usual to get the narrative right with an external audience in mind – and one that is simplified and understandable for reporters – as it is not easily digestible and highly complex.  

In fact, we envision creating separate workstreams to approach positioning, messaging, and talking point development: one geared towards the community (such as those of you who are voting on Politeia) and another with a less technical audience in mind.  

We also believe that both the messaging and cadence of messaging must fit within a proper narrative architecture that will resonate with the intended audiences. In order to accomplish this, Decred must first spend time explaining “why” Decred is a superior protocol. In essence, this means defining the problems and challenges with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Simultaneously, Decred must articulate “who” is being impacted by the lack of governance, scalability, and other limitations. Finally, after you have sufficiently defined the landscape and illustrated who is being impacted by deficiencies, Decred will have the opportunity to solidify and reinforce its true mission and higher value proposition.    

Initially, we would start by reviewing the current messaging and conduct a number of interviews within the community to determine and evaluate what is working and what might need revisiting.  From there, we would formulate a master narrative document that would be agreed upon by the community and serve as a core repository for messaging and talking points.

**2. Media and message training (remote for 6+ individuals)**

Once we have solidified messaging, we will work with Decred’s public-facing spokespeople and provide them the tools to effectively stay on message and tell Decred’s story in a way that connects with the intended audience and drives results. 

In individualized, hour-long media training sessions, we’ll provide instruction on how to handle difficult questions, as well as ensure you have a crisp answer for the easy questions that are important opportunities to drive your message. We’ll then switch gears to practice in one-on-one and mock interview formats. We’ll cover how to handle print, radio, and television interviews and offer guidance on certain techniques that can be leveraged to better answer questions. 

Each interview opportunity Ditto arranges – be it over the phone, in person, or on TV – is an opportunity to deliver Decred’s story, and we don’t want you to miss any opportunities. We also want to ensure nobody screws up. 
 
**3. Provide input on strategy, marketing plan, and coordinate with social media**

Through regularly scheduled weekly meetings, Ditto would integrate closely with Decred’s broader marketing and communications apparatus to provide the necessary input and counsel on planning, marketing, and social media engagement. 

This starts by creating a strategic roadmap that would put in place a month-over-month plan while at the same time identifying the key objectives, deliverables, and intended goals of each activation. Through this iterative process, Ditto would maintain an active monitoring process to see what’s working and where there’s engagement, with the intention to optimize this process over time. 

Ditto believes that any successful strategy and marketing plan must take into account the dynamic media landscape we know today. This requires thoughtful understanding of Decred’s earned, owned, and paid media channels. Ultimately, it will be a combination of all three, but it starts with a foundational approach to secure coverage in high-traffic and reputable media publications. This is then enhanced with a robust content strategy to populate Decred’s owned channels that can serve as a megaphone to the community to provide active engagement on prescient topics. Finally, if it is determined the Decred wants to selectively target a new audience or reinforce a narrative with an existing one, Ditto can craft a highly targeted paid social campaign that would place Decred’s coverage and content in front of those intended targets to elicit their engagement.  
 
Ditto will also provide best-in-class strategies on how to most productively use Twitter, Medium, Reddit, and other social media platforms, and make consistent recommendations aligned with the intended goals and objectives.  

**4. Establish a media outreach to plan to support the efforts and developments of the Decred project**

Ditto prides itself on its deep relationships with reporters who cover crypto, blockchain, and technology startups. Our network extends around the globe, and our clients have garnered coverage from nearly every major print publication (The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Bloomberg, Forbes) and broadcast network (CNBC, Bloomberg TV, Cheddar), as well as the tech publications (TechCrunch, Mashable, VentureBeat, ReCode, Hacker Noon) and crypto trades and podcasts (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, Null TX, Unchained, Unconfirmed, etc).

In synchronization with the month-over-month plan, Ditto would spearhead a coordinated engagement strategy connecting Decred with reporters and publications that we identify as the most ideal. This would likely consist of a series of informational interviews, either in person or over the phone, to a core set of reporters that Ditto knows well and communicates with on a consistent basis. Additionally, leveraging a combination of “hard news” announcements from the Decred community and current trends and developments, Ditto will regularly interface with reporters with weekly pitches and point-of-view statements to proactively keep Decred in front of the media. This will be accomplished with a closely coordinated effort with the Ditto and Decred teams. 

**5. Review internally written Decred blogs and bylines contributed in Decred Slack/Matrix channels**

An important part of the roadmap and month-over-month plan will be to establish a strategic content calendar that identifies important topics and areas of focus that the Decred community, in coordination with Ditto, will produce every month. Ideally, the output would be 3-5 pieces of content per month. 

This will be a collaborative process through which Ditto and Decred will brainstorm specific topics and assign various writing roles and responsibilities. In some instances, Decred will draft the content that can be refined and edited by Ditto’s team of former journalists and editors, and in other instances, Ditto will draft the content, which will be edited and finalized in a process we determine to be efficient.  

Once each piece of content is in its final form, a determination will be made where the content should be placed — either with an external media outlet or on a Decred-owned property. Ditto has a strong track record of securing placement for bylines in notable publications and will own the process of submitting each respective byline or op-ed to the appropriate editor at each publication. 

**6. Event coordination and scheduling interviews for Decred representatives**

Through Ditto’s week-over-week proactive outreach to reporters, we will formalize a process by which submitting interview opportunities to Decred’s spokespeople will be seamless and efficient. Ditto will submit the request in an easily digestible format through the preferred channels (Email, Discord, Slack, etc.) and coordinate all scheduling and facilitation — serving as a booking hub between the journalist and the interviewee. 

For each interview, be it in person or over the phone, a Ditto team member will be present to take notes and provide assistance. Following the interview, Ditto will provide any feedback and facilitate the delivery of any additional information that might be required to ensure the interviews translates into coverage.  

For conferences and events, Ditto routinely works with organizers in advance to secure media lists and will conduct outreach if a member of the Decred community is attending or making a presentation. We will facilitate one-on-one interviews and informal meetings to ensure the reporters attending these conferences can hear from and interact with Decred.  

**7. 2019 Event planning**

Conferences and events will be an important component to the strategic roadmap. We can help you strategically plan your meetups and investor conferences. From Consensus to Money 20/20 to the Milken Institute Global Conference to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ditto has positioned our clients at leading conferences and has its finger on the pulse of where the thought leaders in crypto and blockchain are speaking. We also have a deep appreciation for which conferences are worth attending. 

We can help position Decred on the right stages — giving you a platform to communicate your message to your multiple audiences. We believe that Decred has the opportunity to capitalize on the high level of interest in crypto and should also be speaking at or attending both crypto/blockchain conferences hacker-led conferences like Devcon and Black Hat. We can take care of the application process and vetting, making it a turnkey experience for Decred.  

**8. Crisis communications**

As everyone in crypto knows, something can go wrong in an instant, and you need to be prepared for the worst. You get hacked. The community is angry. Breaking news negatively impacts your project.

Ditto can provide Decred with crisis planning and help you prepare to mitigate the impact of a crisis if one occurs. When you hire us, you get a team of experienced crisis experts who have led large crisis response across a range of industries who are available 24/7 to manage communications and strategy.  

We can implement a communications response protocol to ensure alignment and real-time communication in the event of a crisis that poses the potential for reputation impact. We can also help you identify potential vulnerabilities and develop proactive and reactive messaging so that if a crisis ensues, Decred is prepared.
