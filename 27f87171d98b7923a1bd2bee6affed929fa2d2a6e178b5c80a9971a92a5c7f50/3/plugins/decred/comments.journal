I ask because the proposal represents a substantial commitment from both parties. Would there be value in scaling up the services in lieu of $30k out of the gate to ensure it's an appropriate fit? Something like starting around $10k and incrementing up by $5k/mo until the services provided are sufficient for the network needs. I also think this proposal would be better received by stakeholders if it included a shorter out clause, something like 30 days.","signature":"db77645a6790e1ddf4f915b9efcf2b636b410e82e5fb0edb316d0e658e352a506cd5dc6afbef855850ae75bc9a908337572fdd25271d9b753c2a65bfcb783301","publickey":"dbc137c9276d6f5a3dcc3422406d15cb07b3036f57308a3c6bca90648e3577ab","commentid":"1","receipt":"632a3ac6d4edeb4bc1e22446d83a2f033b19da410b9299ef5c9a848b5f329cad52a06dde5be49d3e8e435f0dce432be5849651a3dfed247bbb2c22ec6ca1310b","timestamp":1540166409,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Our treasury is backed entirely by DCR. As such, a proposal requiring payment in USD is problematic for a number of reasons.\n\n1. It displays a lack of confidence in the project on the part of the firm making the proposal.\n2. It requires the use of an intermediary to accept DCR and then convert it to USD so payment can be made.\n3. It negates our ability to create an ecosystem in which Decred is used as a currency, and in the ideal scenario, our contractors potentially become stakeholders.\n\nI also find the stipulation requiring 90 days of notice for termination to be a huge red flag. Exposing the project to an additional $90K USD of costs in the event we see a need to terminate the relationship is unwarranted, to say the least.","signature":"e1e5f8490e2a78ef2087803c53ca4b61b72b45eea14e87708c201133b4c3d3d9ffb65ec524b31370234d86ce15fb528d41dcea6fb4ddf554fa532c4a2bdbfa0a","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"3","receipt":"7d260df729111a1d73685fa76633077f38320971de6198df9d1270a747bd1045a7565a53a132e8722fb43147b1187b669b4218d6c6dcc8bcd09678fc92212201","timestamp":1540192706,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think the Decred marketing team is doing a good job with the selection of events we appear at. Mind you, though your team can point to numerous events and conferences in the crypto space does not mean that their profiles necessarily aligns with Decred's goals, e.g. attending buzzwordy conferences with 95% ICO in attendance.\n2. An apparent no prior interest in Decred and disbursement of 2/3rds of monthly funds for the campaign in fiat does highlight a lack of belief in the success of the project; the 1/3rd payable in DCR being a \"safe\" investment for when/if it makes it big.\n3. 3 months of termination notice is just a dealbreaker for me.","signature":"942f218e48e5d68d7271c305205f414e2a84c6b4567dd25c85a524f3202ca03f89556278eb4c29f5f634102c77ca5ddad9ef79dcd15eb4ab75e293c417229d05","publickey":"3f5d5b555251e70ca8ae1c1c2ef5f03797c21f06dba38071d52a5167347ad7d7","commentid":"4","receipt":"2ad452312bca3f7c1421208b78d8bf8c1868be2c57be7f97a9857c115709c46c3ed43172ed341a7272a6a474bf6d21e71d521dc1b6f3a3165791d595e79d190b","timestamp":1540201954,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We did help rewrite the Politea press release, which resulted from several productive conversations with multiple Decred members over the past few weeks. You can see the final result [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181016005342/en/Decred-Launches-Politeia-Self-Governance-System-Release-20-Million).\n\nImportantly, Ditto was founded on “introductory retainers,” which means proving ourselves and growing. From what we understand, though, there’s a lot of work to be done. We are firm believers in only proposing what a client truly needs (and what we know we can succeed at). And sometimes that means doing one thing really well and growing from there.\n\nSix months is a pretty standard length for a PR campaign — it’s what you’ll encounter with just about any firm you work with. We do offer a 90 day termination clause, meaning if we don’t do what we said we would do in the first 90 days, you have every right to fire us. Honestly, no one has ever utilized that clause.\n\nOne more point about our prior experience. We have worked with many serious projects with a long-term roadmap — everyone from Monero to Augur to Chronicled to Origin to Kadena to CoinList – the list goes on. We are a PR firm that has proven itself in the past two years as a team that knows blockchain.\n\nAlso, we pride ourselves on being capable of handling as much of the work as possible. Other PR firms definitely aren’t like that. We will request a thorough onboarding and be true partners moving forward, meaning we will be doing most of the work. Our ability to do this is because we deeply understand blockchain and Decred’s value more than your typical PR firm.","signature":"f44334ca5e6cc11c6933562eb3f63b7df7a5c7687179296e0ef21c0dd29f7367bb26b6630ab2be6304f6de51cddd92373ea8066637f16a959fc19457565bd006","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"7","receipt":"09a645f267511d55f1ec94f408a0ead1906f1b6b6e9d294751375b8a21899062d471bda5aef44941d3fc3e9b2b89f57ca7288667169444e0ecdab5324b9e740d","timestamp":1540249309,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If DCR suffers a catastrophic event that puts the price into a significant downturn, you're stuck with a contract to fulfill, accepting money that's loosing value every day.

The majority of our clients are startups, so we understand how valuable time is.\n\nOne of the things I’ve noticed when companies meet with us is they say, “You know, our last PR firm had good ideas but it just translated to more work for us. And we don’t have time to do all that.” We pride ourselves in making sure Ditto does all the heavy lifting. Doesn’t mean we won’t need some of your valuable time. But it’s also why we are considered the “anti PR Agency.” We do things the right way, which isn’t how other PR firms do it.\n\nA good PR plan actually takes time OFF your schedule. If we create a smart plan, prioritize, etc., Ditto can then execute without having to bother you too much. I’d argue a good PR plan maximizes the time you have – not add on more time. And it’s why we don’t charge by the hour, like most PR firms. We’d much rather get BIG results in less time than the opposite of that.\n\nBacking up a little more, we work with developers ranging from coding bootcamps to founders to blockchain companies. So, we understand how to work with devs. Also, we are a new source for your community. A dev may have a question about something PR related, and Ditto is 24/7 on demand to answer any and everything.\n\nFinally, Ditto has succeeded and grown over the years based on one simple reason: we are results focused. It’s right in our little motto: Strategy, execution, results.","signature":"b54e9c04f7c1c3e71f3252517f4d87942f0295bf831d2daa601584554b131e67c123b7588588c4da3251e132abcb89ad562b0a8f6bfefe868ab1000e3ef02f0a","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"21","receipt":"3eb09e121297d4863393131a41fcecf2201fcca6b066039198a9efaf9d2434434f5f03404010717cb7ed5b0057460937ef0c83675d00a0fc3a9c2b0871978808","timestamp":1540323384,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

So I will repeat the same train of thought from Wachsmans commentary: \n\n\u003e “Key Messaging and Brand Narrative Development + Content Creation\nThis is the only item I have some concerns about. There are three people listed in the team with mostly directional roles, however none with a dedicated focus on creative copywriting or a creative strategy work. (These are marked as secondary roles.)\nWorking out key messaging + a communications strategy and documenting it in a reasonable way has been an item that I've discussed with 2 or 3 no longer present marketing contributors, of who none successfully delivered any useful results. So this should not be taken lightly.\nAlthough DCR has a number of excellent in-house writers, I would say we've always been missing the creative copywriting types. The issue here is that documentation writing, research writings, journalism writings and creative copywriting are all very different animals. A lot of the comms. output so far has been written by a group. Comparing it objectively to brands who have it created by dedicated professionals – these will never be on the same level.\nWhen it comes to creative copywriting, communication strategy creation and such – to get something actually useful worked out in DCR's context, this task absolutely needs at least one specialized senior level copywriter (or creative director, strategist whatever the title w/ similar background) with a strong, demonstrable track-record (e.g. case studies). Reason being that the scope itself is already way too big for a non-dedicated or directional roles to cover: building an deep understanding, creating objectives and devising strategies to accomplish them, concepting work, creative problem solving, imaginativness and eye for detail, going in-depth with calibrating the voice and articulations, having an understanding of various aspects of branding, awarness and ability to tell difference between short lived trends and timeless techniques, strong judgement and projection skills on outcomes, ability to sync with the design direction, etc… You get my point.\nAlso in case there's plan of using shadow-writers to assist the key personnel – this has been tried and did not work well. I'm in favour of the actual people doing the work being behind the table and accountable.\nThis essentially will work as a tool and a standard for everyone who wants to communicate about Decred – meaning that tangible deliverables and well accessible documentation of the work are of importance here. For one potential benchmark, I would suggest to take a look at the project https://brand.estonia.ee/story/core-messages/ where quite reasonable communication guidelines were developed for a large (and obviously even harder to define) entity – this being a country, but it's end use case is similar to DCR as it's meant for very different businesses and individuals.\nObviously one of the most difficult parts of the project will be getting the ultimate agreement on what goes. I'm well aware that having too many cooks in the kitchen will mess up the work and I obviously don't recommend this. Preferably the concept development process could include a small number of expert contributors covering the key disciplines of the projects. Only once a rough consensus on a solution is agreed, this can be brought out for larger reviewing. Also type of involvement, tasks and responsibilities for each participant should be well defined from the start to.”\n\nFrom what i’ve seen at dittopr.co, the case studies are very oriented towards the statistical/reach and journalism outputs. I would be rather interested in seeing work that demonstrates more tangible outputs of creative problem solving, thought and strategic ability, and even sheer writing ability, and this being in a brands context rather than only journalism. Ideally this should relate to the expected outputs planned for Decred and have the work talk for itself. \n\nConsidering the Wachsmans competitive proposal is up also, what would you consider your main edge on them? \n\nThanks.","signature":"4327c6d713b7de22835411e927f21342ad28157be2f6290fbce4623aaac13eb19ff9779ba192a0d2b77a374398f262d62aa7fb161d77367ee5575439f52b0304","publickey":"23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","commentid":"22","receipt":"fbe144c37bdd54410c0959bc93468b8d0b74aa3039327ab65f472d017dbfc456427da2afc62a9e743d066c91c6acb975f88cf80b73599e423250f05e1133aa02","timestamp":1540330293,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I’m sitting here with Trey, and this question sparked a good discussion. We have a lot to cover from this comment. First, let me say you are asking all the right questions. We are enjoying answering all of them!\n\n“Positioning, messaging and talking points” is probably one of the most important things Ditto does for its blockchain clients. I’d add “media training,” as well.\n\nWhat you say and how you say it is critical to achieve what we are trying to accomplish. And from Ledger to Origin to Monero to Kadena, we spent a lot of time early on working on this. For some clients, it was more about what they say to different audiences. For other clients, it was about simply coming up with one document on “how to explain ourselves.” We’ve been doing that a lot recently. In a decentralized company, we’d like for everyone to be able to explain who they work for as similarly as possible. That is important not only for journalists, but for internal purposes, as well.\n\nA lot of the founders we work with – many, if not most, are devs – have never done an interview before. So we need to make sure that 1) they know what to say and 2) they are comfortable conducting an interview. That’s why media training is important. We want to make sure that when you talk to anyone from CoinDesk to The New York Times (which you will), you crush it.\n\nI hope that answers one part of your question.\n\nMoving on…\n\nTrey, who founded Ditto, was originally a reporter at the Associated Press. Writing will always be important at Ditto. In fact, we recently hired a VP Kris Kitto, who was also a reporter in Washington D.C. Kris oversees content at Ditto and regularly teaches the rest of us how to be a better writer. Everyone at Ditto is expected to be a good writer. That’s also because we are generalists, meaning we pride ourselves on being good at all the core tenets of PR. Ditto isn’t for everyone. There are PR people out there who JUST want to manage clients or JUST do media relations. A lot of us have some kind of specialty, but we are pretty freakin’ good at all the core communications offerings.\n\nAlso, Ditto is top heavy, meaning most of us are senior-level PR people. Every account has a team that can think strategically, give good advice, and execute a plan. The biggest complaint we get from incoming clients looking for a new PR firm is the “bait and switch.” Sold by senior PR execs, only to get handed off to junior people. We are about 80+% super smart senior PR people. You just don’t get that at other PR firms, where pitching is relegated to junior people and some senior people only do strategy. Not at Ditto. You can see that from the team we proposed. I don’t want to talk too much about Wachsman, who I respect and talk to regularly, but Ditto is outspoken about what makes us different and better, and I think this is an important differentiator to point out. Our team is senior-level PR people. We don’t staff our accounts with one person who’s just good at events, and one senior person who would probably just “manage.” That’s just not how we operate… and it’s working!\n\nA bit of “how the sausage is made:” Every account is required to come up with one smart idea every month. What does that mean? It means strategic advice is mandatory at Ditto. It means that we are thinkers and doers.\n\nI wish we had time to update some of our case studies, but we’ve been busy on client work. That’s another difference between Ditto and our competitors. We are a bunch of super smart PR folks who do a ton of crypto and blockchain work. Every client is important, and every week we bust our ass to give them good counsel and get them the awareness they deserve. Big PR firms have sales people and marketing people who can create case studies on messaging to make them sound good. We just haven’t had the time to do that yet.","signature":"e4fc46d30ed2805f070aa14d9f851ee1d04a3c01118a453e09db9f00af97f554d544adfd759151d1e7b4d6f1c8b00187b7b8f7855058f14a4c85cc916251220d","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"23","receipt":"342362d87853e0a9e128f535d51b701e45c9a89c6361badaa97ae001bcdaec190082885b892526e4e52c9ee78a56919fd776d123c08a882fffdcdc1a2e065008","timestamp":1540342057,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As you stated, you already have a third party (from the Decred dev team) willing to provide you with the USD portion of your proposal.\n\nWhy not, simply lay out a separate contract between you and that party to process the DCR \u003c=\u003e USD exhange according to the terms agreed and remove the USD requirement from this proposal?\n\nOtherwise, the problem I see is that the Decred entity itself has no central authority and cannot for example, open a bank account and process USD payments.\n\nThe various stakeholders like myself, who together form this decentralized entity, only have the ability to allow DCR payments from the treasury by voting on proposals. So you may find difficult to have them agree to enter a contract in which they are required to do something impossible (make payments in USD).\n\nFurthermore, as the goal is to eventually have payments made automatically using a smart contract based on votes, this kind of DCR/USD arrangements in a proposal will eventually not be possible anymore unless an intermediary makes the proposal in DCR, and then contract the services is USD.\n\nFinally one danger of leaving the proposal \"as is\", is that it leaves the impression for future proposal, that the treasury can be disbursed to contractors in USD (which is technically false and can only be achieved with a third party).","signature":"53a224b2da5ff904946ddde17b96df527d4abd71107139e4629b7601b7caa97348e85b7b60488352478e2f34a0ddfe8e346c61a47e9b0f5b591bb921021d5307","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"24","receipt":"6d103862d992de73de4b9cabb67c5241dd72661910c363b92ae5596d829a4049b1a8fdcc1c61e2945ab243880d80c0a7744cdaea300d8f702e0369830f7fd101","timestamp":1540342294,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Before I can make up my mind on how to vote I have a few questions and remarks, some more fundamental to Decred in general than others.\n\nFirst off, how do you envision your impact on Decred after the contract is over? And to be more precise on this point, what are you deliverables? How, as stakeholders, do we test your performance? Where and in what manner will you report? How do we hold you accountable? This is important to know, because how otherwise do we make use of the opt-out clause.\n\nWho is paying the Decred representatives you media train? Who selects these representatives? Will they be paid from this budget? Will event registration fees and other associated costs (like hotel, etc) that you arrange be paid from this budget?\n\nAnd as a more fundamental question tied to this, who are the people that are representing Decred? We have yet to see a proposal in the spirit of 'I want to represent Decred at events,' or 'this company/group of people wants to take care of event representation and presence.'\nAre you proposing to train Company 0 employees or freelancers or your own employees?\n\nThen as others have asked in both this proposal and the other marketing one, (why) do you think Decred needs your entire proposed suite of services for a relatively short 6-month period?","signature":"13d62bbfcd360e236e33f157c27f6cb449b160af56b1c0873205e41288bc4b6b6295b3ec2fbc9ece70315322f240fbce1632d5aa6661aaeecb5125166e66140f","publickey":"00c09bb145ae4ddf1d5ec5a6a80e2697d081e8cf906600c3fca7a9f0e2dca0ab","commentid":"31","receipt":"53861a2da20cc0daa8f60c1d9dbd597f6e15d69ba7e89940405b9363c21f90274889cc862f49c2501ddd51232251eea244e5614eb13c524dfa7566c9a4adad09","timestamp":1540469720,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It starts by aligning on KPIs and objectives, which will be determined as part of the onboarding process. We’ve already talked about some of the objectives that the community believes are important, but we’ll want to get specific. For instance: How many pieces of coverage per month, how many pieces of content we will produce, how many events per quarter, etc.  That said, we only propose what we think a client needs.\n\nThings we think about:\n1) Expert sourcing – When reporters write about governance issues they should be quoting someone from Decred\n2) Proactive pitching – Identify monthly issues/topics relevant to Decred that will generate media coverage\n3) Quality vs. quantity – We want to balance top tier crypto (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, etc.) with top tier mainstream (NYT, WSJ, Laura Shin, Bloomberg)\n4) Decred features – What story lines provide us opportunities to get those bigger stories? We should always be thinking big.\n5) News announcements – Do we want to get one really good story through an exclusive, or do we reach out to a handful of reporters?\n\nOnce we align in understanding where there is opportunity, we can then layout expected outputs. Ballpark, we tend to get 5-10 pieces of coverage each month for our crypto clients. Where there’s news, it’s even higher.\n\nOnboarding takes no more than 30 days, ideally. This is some of the most important foundation work we will do. This includes messaging, identifying topics/issues Decred should be talking about, looking at any upcoming announcements, news opportunities, etc. We are a results-focused PR firm, so we love outputs and deliverables.\n\nWe tend to have a weekly check-in with our clients. Most of that is accountability: What have we done this week, what are we doing next week. Also, there’s some accountability on the client side: We need X and Y from you (without creating too much extra work on your end). Again, this is a partnership.\n\nWhat we are most eager to get to is the harder results: media coverage, securing speaking engagements, publishing op-eds, etc. One of the things our team couldn’t stand while working at bigger, global PR firms was 30, 60, 90 days into a new client, the firm was still “strategizing” and “creating memos,” but the client was like “Yeah, but where are the results??” There’s a lot of important foundational work to be done, but Ditto is always eager to “go external.”\n\nI would check with Dustin from Decred on additional fees. Things like travel and conference fees are not traditionally included in PR plans. Also, on who is representing Decred. That would be part of what we’d hope to discover during the onboarding process. The same is true for media training. Once we identify who or whom will be representing Decred from an external standpoint, we will train them on certain aspects of how to engage with the media that will hopefully ensure leads to coverage with the right message being conveyed. All media training is included in the price of the monthly agreement.","signature":"9a1bb3540602f91bc0668c686abf1a0ef53095b869f8b2f64d417551132bedcaaab2500ec74143fe3ad85dfbd0cde3b8407cced4f7aa9d55964171d89e1a0704","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"32","receipt":"bd39c1c6de7bbebb08615a34e9a09c5adca7f397b3ec85c92684863869ce0d1585de8805a308ee46b4c34a330c5f935edefaf7f30b7d8489cf24889e0a868c01","timestamp":1540487434,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I wanted to cross-post and address a few other questions we’ve been getting on the Decred Slack channel for everyone's awareness.\n\n**First, what are the main differences between Wachsman and Ditto?**\n\nThis is a really good and important question. As we alluded to in our proposal on Politeia, Ditto is very much an “anti-PR firm” in that we fundamentally believe the traditional business model of PR firms is broken.\n\nFirstly, everyone at Ditto has a technical level of expertise and understands the nuances of blockchain/crypto in a way that far surpasses our competitors.\n\nSecondly, we understand your culture and your community, and we share your values. We’ve worked with decentralized communities like Monero that place a premium on privacy and unanimity. We’ve listened to the feedback the community has given, and we’ve made the necessary adjustments. We understand and appreciate the unique characteristics that make the Decred community what it is, which will translate into the right kind of advice and partnership when it comes time to do the work, versus more traditional marketing tactics or buzzwords.\n\nThe third and most important differentiator is results. We believe in radical honestly and transparency and will only tell you what we believe to be possible. What you see is what you get, and we’re happy to provide a synopsis of the results we’ve gotten over the years. Our vast network of reporters and the relationships we have in the media value this, as well. So when we pitch a story or reach out to a journalist, they know and appreciate the companies that work with Ditto are of the highest legitimacy and credibility.\n\nFinally, Ditto is top heavy, meaning most of us are senior-level PR people. Every account has a team that can think strategically, give good advice, and execute a plan. The biggest complaint we get from incoming clients looking for a new PR firm is the “bait and switch.” Sold by senior PR execs, only to get handed off to junior people. We are about 80+% super smart senior PR people. You just don’t get that at other PR firms, where pitching is relegated to junior people and some senior people only do strategy. Not at Ditto. You can see that from the team we proposed (more on that in a bit).\n\n**Next question: Can you justify the 5k extra that Ditto is asking for compared to Wachsman?**\n\nAs outlined in our conversations with the Decred community prior to this process, the fee matches the proposed scope of work. Content, media relations, conferences/events, thought leadership, and the amount of time and resources we would devote to this led us to $25K in DCR. If it is determined that the community only wants content and media relations, as opposed to conferences and events, we can adjust the proposal and the price accordingly. I also want to point out that both our CEO Trey Ditto and myself — the two most senior people at Ditto — will staff the account and give you personalized attention.\n\n**Next question: I see you have a Monero as one of your clients. Someone asked Ricardo his involvement with ditto and he mentioned that he worked with your company on a personal level not with Monero. Could you please elaborate.**\n\nWe worked with Monero around their Project Coral Reef announcement, and we were subsequently hired by Tari, a project by Ric and Naveen. That, to us, indicates that they were pleased with the level of service we provided and hired us for a launch announcement that was widely covered. It’s worth noting, like with a lot of clients, we do know Ric on a personal level, as well. We are partners with our clients. By the way, here’s [an article]( http://fortune.com/2018/05/23/crypto-blockchain-monero-ticketfly-project-tari/) we generated in Fortune for the Tari announcement and here’s [an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/12/05/cryptocurrency-monero-to-be-accepted-by-musicians-such-as-mariah-carey-g-eazy-sia-for-holidays/#1955c93060eb) we generated in Forbes for Monero. There we of course multiple other outlets that covered this news.  \n\n**And finally: Would you be able to provide a list of Ditto team members who we can expect to interact with on a daily basis?**\n\nThe Ditto team members who would interact with you on a regular basis are the ones listed in our proposal: our CEO Trey Ditto, Managing Director Blain Rethmeier, Vice President Margaret Huang, Account Executive Milvian Prieto, and Associate Vice President Liz Bagot.","signature":"1e00a6419d34f50b3471688092ebc0c3b95482f18387ec51a14000be7579e21c9b8c3563d38041f859475bfa95f931ef9ff7e151d335dabfffa2dc347f7f6a02","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"33","receipt":"b3f9a71a0b810e70ddbb3d4731bf9a6fef8382667394db6224286b116e2e7e785a1f37508748f0ea094eacd4123bc14c548dd21e3fa67d2e85f1d7efdb4cd50a","timestamp":1540494071,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But if we are being honest, one of the reasons Ditto and Wachsman are the top two crypto PR firms out there is because of our results. Top tier results are what we have in common! That’s good news for Decred.\n\nSo, [here’s a smattering of coverage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPcDM7hjwgNDxlkQOmZ3ChW2EQzbtBl6wpHZZk4_1Mo/edit?usp=sharing) we’ve secured for some of crypto clients over the past year. \n\nWe chose the past year as the timeframe because we want to show that we didn’t just have a lucky couple of weeks — this is month over month consistency and delivering on what we promised. And we chose a handful of clients and just a sampling of coverage because that should show you that media coverage is one of the things we are good at.\n\nBut even in the past week, clients have had features in everything from _CoinDesk_ to _SF Business Times_ to _Bloomberg TV_ to _Breaker Magazine_ to _The Block_. We could be here all day just going through “media hits”!\n\nWhen I look at our list and Wachsman’s list, there are a few differences: Ditto has a much more robust mix of national TV, top tier crypto, and top tier mainstream. Don’t get me wrong — there are some Tier 2/3, but our coverage seems a little more elevated.\n\nAlso, the final thing I’d add, just looking at Wachsman’s coverage, is that they have a lot of stories written by contributors, whereas we tend to work directly with staff reporters. One, working directly with reporters means more people will read the story. Two — and we aren’t saying this is the case — but a lot of contributors are pay-to-play. That’s just not our style.\n\nIn the interest of moving beyond just getting clients hits, there’s a backstory to every time a client is in the news. What went into that?\n\n1)    **Being proactive** – Ditto saw a trend in the industry and positioned the client\n\n2)    **Important issues** – Clients have issues/topics (community, scaling, speed, security, etc.), and we keep them in the news on those issues\n\n3)    **Messaging** – We put in the time to make sure we are relaying to the media the clients’ stories in a way that ensures positive coverage\n\n4)    **Talking Points** – Before any interview, we think about, “What do we want to say in this specific interview to get our point across?”\n\n5)    **Media training** – Could be as simple as a quick mock interview the day before, but we make sure the client is as ready as possible\n\nSo, while we can just look at volume and quality, at Ditto, there’s a lot more care that goes into what ends up being printed.","signature":"0421a68e06a351ba0c62a1d7d7f56480859b99f1da69577769664e0ce2e71eb76186368917c218f5ecfc531d1c023e636e97fac0ae3a4fd8363797d53501ed0a","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"34","receipt":"63c686853241c4a50ce57307743fac459d1ca7eb3e806cace415d4472afec00972c02321731d2fd3c190c8188f1d0dca0c0362a72e12ee5c596d67251bcf030b","timestamp":1540503319,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You made an important point, and something we try to achieve in our work: Whatever we do should tie back to an objective or a goal. We will need to work with the community to determine which specific metrics Decred wants to impact so that we can measure them — and this is something we will want to determine at the very beginning of our relationship.\n\nThe plan we laid out focuses on community growth and engagement by raising your visibility, elevating your brand and better defining your value proposition to externally facing audiences.\n\nMetrics aside, there is something to be said about overall “awareness.” Many of our clients who have never done PR before say “We just want the community to know about us more.” And a lot of that work is targeting devs and the crypto community. It’s hard to measure awareness, although we utilize a few platforms to gauge traction of stories. And we are constantly monitoring what is and isn’t working and making adjustments.\n\nRegarding timing, we can’t think of a better time than now. Politeia is live, and we’re at the very beginning of a revolution. PR now will help drive awareness, facilitate development, and increase awareness of future Decred updates. It’s important to get started as early as possible — especially now that the product is live and working, and real proposals are being written and voted on.

Every month client teams come together and set their metrics that align with each client. Every account is different, but it basically includes: quantity and quality of media coverage, content written and published and one what we call an “extended communication” (social media, speaking, award submission, partnership, etc.). \n\nAs we have said in other comments, we believe in going much farther than outputs, which we are really good at. We also measure quality of service. Every account has to come together and send the client one “smart idea” each month. This pushes us to be creative, proactive and always trying something new. \n\nThe best feedback we got once was from Avi Flombaum, co-founder of Flatiron School: Every month Ditto sent us a new idea, pushing us to stay ahead. We didn’t act on many of them, which was more an internal thing on our end, but it showed us that Ditto understood our business and was always thinking about us. \n\nFinally, we have a “client facing” section, meaning we should be talking to the client on a personal and professional level every month. Again, we are your partner! Our internal metrics – which Trey has to approve – are historically higher than what the client expects. Here’s the fun part: Every team that does all these things: hits their outputs, sends a creative idea and interacts with the client gets a bonus at the end of the month.\n\nIt’s why Ditto is a better PR firm. We believe in doing high quality, high output work and then rewarding staffers for doing killer work.\n\nExamples of interactions. First, I’m happy to put you in touch with Avi from Flatiron School. They were a client for 4 years – until WeWork bought them. It’s the perfect example of Ditto:\n1) Lifelong partners – As I said above, it was a deep partnership where we cared about them and vice versa. Trey and Avi became best friends in fact.\n2) Month over month results – for 4 years, they averaged 100+ stories every year.\n3) High quality – They were front page WSJ, Business Section B1 of NYT, on national TV 4+ times a year.\n4) Results attached to business – When we got them coverage, website traffic spiked and sign-ups happened.\n5) Positioning – Flatiron School went from maybe #4 coding bootcamp in the country to #1 based on our work and their high quality service.\n\nWe have crypto examples too:\n- [CoinList](https://www.dittopr.co/portfolio-item/coinlist/)\n- [Monero](https://www.dittopr.co/portfolio-item/monero/)\n\nWe need to do some more crypto case studies. Just been too busy doing PR work than marketing ourselves. Hopefully you understand we balance strategy, quality, quantity and client relations better than anyone else.\n\nWe would set Decred targets in our onboarding meeting. Something super easy to set now is Decred will be interviewed and get media coverage in the top crypto and mainstream publications. From _CoinDesk_ to _New York Times_ to Laura Shin's podcast, we can promise that Decred will gain recognition in all top tier outlets. We are confident about this because all of our clients (as you saw in our media coverage examples) get this attention. \n\nFor events, we’d like to see Decred have an elevated presence. This means speaking at the high-quality crypto conferences. This does NOT mean having booth babes and going to conferences that are a waste of time.","signature":"4d36bf83c7bb5e9a107f6a1420120a157dc2f3045dc3e4d4bb49942fe3d5ca366ffd48ea039bb26042a25481326543d29f2c0a6c3b2740f961b098e945540405","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"38","receipt":"520cfcb25e268dba89dfe0d62777b4f4f64acf75fa0f1ca45bd8985498cef65d183d9cad8a480f1b07b96a77ac425ae563ffa04dff8b511db016f76f4abcf10e","timestamp":1540680285,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

For the past 2 years, the \"major media\" was acting weird in relation to Decred.

They have answered most of my own questions, but some remained.\n\n1\\. In case both your and Wachsman's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with them?\n\n2\\. What do you think about using textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for (some)  materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work?\n\n3\\. Do you have influence in non-English space, and any plans in relation to it in the scope of this proposal?\n\n4\\. What do you think about \"anti-events\" when instead of (or in addition to) high profile, paid, expensive events that only crypto geeks attend, you go straight to the people. Example is what Raedah Group (Decred's contractor) did [in Portland](https://twitter.com/raedahgroup).\n\n5\\. Do you have any connections to attract more talented developers? Any such plans in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability.\n\n6\\. Will there be any legal contracts?

Trey answered this on Reddit and our counsel is that we don’t believe you need two PR firms. But we have worked with other PR firms with other clients in the past (typically the other firm has a very specific focus separate from ours), and it worked out.\n\n2.    We think creating materials that have maximum utility is important and sharing is going to be important to this campaign — and there will definitely be times where we should get the Decred community’s insight.\n\n3.    We do quite a bit of work in Asia — we have a couple of Chinese clients, just finished helping launch Ledger’s Hong Kong office, and have helped facilitate interviews in Chinese. Additionally, we have relationships with the Russian media. I think once we get a good work flow going and we earn your trust and prove ourselves, we should as quickly as possible add that on. A lot of the U.S. media is translated and read by China, Japan, Korea, Russia, etc.\n\n4.    You’re right — there is so much noise at conferences and events. A lot of our clients don’t even have the budget – or desire – to pay to play. We should definitely think about how to “hijack” a conference and develop an \"anti-event\" strategy.  \n\n5.    Trey also just touched on this on Reddit. I think much of the work we will do will better define Decred and elevate awareness of Decred within the Dev community. But at some point, we have to think of more direct ways to get in front of devs. That will definitely be part of our campaign, and we’d want to listen and talk to you all to figure out the best way to do it.\n\n6.    Dustin is probably the best person to answer that question. But yes, there will be a contract.","signature":"2d131ed087432ecb7e5ba19bdb919493ea0816a66ceb00b79535c0f73f21d44b6e704e9650370b7129cbdc753ca55cac56d51782ff203cb7fe0ec1366e8c7809","publickey":"9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","commentid":"44","receipt":"0af1c1b6655087b04b6ccc5358ef8b286d1bbfa58b2082324f15e814d510ebcdcead55fdd2542f345ac6e651e06c820cb307571cb5470c9292ee07d2f165c206","timestamp":1540919670,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
