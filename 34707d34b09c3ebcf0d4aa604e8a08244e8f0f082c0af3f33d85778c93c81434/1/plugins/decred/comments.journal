DCR is already available for on Easyrabbit it seems, and the relatively small price for the \"upgrade\" comes with some real benefits to Decred, which do come at a cost to this exchange.\n\nSpecifically, (1) widget integration and (2) lower fees for users, come at a cost to the exchange and have obvious benefits to users of DCR.  Arguably, this is true for social media promotion where there's only so much room for tweets about the coins they support.\n\nOn the other hand, paying to put the DCR logo in their \"featured section\" is arguably of less value and feels a bit against our values.  Is that different from social media promotion?  Maybe not much, but the reach of social media is important for informing/reminding those already interested in DCR that there is another service they can use.  But featured placement on their homepage does not seem necessary if you come to the site already knowing what you want to do (hopefully buy DCR).\n\nWhat can go wrong with this proposal? \"Constant promotion\" sounds a bit like spam everyone all the time.  Also, the mere acceptance of this proposal could reflect poorly, if it weren't for the redeeming fact that 30 DCR is a modest sum that is actually appropriate for the added services.\n\nAnother consideration is what volume does this site have and how much benefit do these lowered fees offer DCR user, in aggregate?","signature":"1d356d26cdd18b5a6e2a85b8fd50ccbfbf52795672e2c79d417ea437e1afa14b1e54072c11b722efe4a7f8015b852e946c7aa420431c01035ffc3531d2042e00","publickey":"22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","commentid":"3","receipt":"08da21270be1f34f2cfc8a091abd16369d6afbdb58f0d9312f1a8703fccc2cbee15ba8737dbf29d5b3fd7cc7e43760706b2b6a54924e4dee64d547d8b9c6b80c","timestamp":1541017899,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
