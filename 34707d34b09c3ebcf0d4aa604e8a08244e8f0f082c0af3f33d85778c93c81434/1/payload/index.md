Premium Listing for Decred on Easyrabbit
One of the biggest problems in cryptospace is that most of exchanges require a user authentication. Easyrabbit believes that traders-holders identity is not a government business. As a result, we offer our clients the ability to exchange their cryptocurrencies **anonymously**, **securely** and as **easy** as possible. 

Most of you would noticed that from 30/10/18 DCR is available on Easyrabbit both for deposit and for receival. We tried harshly to provide the best rates and fees (0.2% - 0.5% depending on trading pair) from any other platform similar to Easyrabbit. Thus we decided to give you, DCR community, the option to decide whether you want to upgrade the listing to premium. 

Someone would think what does it even mean? Premium Listing on Easyrabbit means:

*1) Listing DCR logo on our homepage in the featured section, so as all of our users to be informed about DCR.*

*2) Special fee offers in order to provide even smaller fees for DCR.*

*3) Constant promotion for DCR in our social media.*

*4) 0% fees for one week after upgrade.*

*5) Widget integration, in order Decred website visitors to have the ability to buy DCR directly from Decred website*

*6) DCR will be part in all of our future projects*


The upgrade will cost **30 DCR** so it is in your hands if it will be upgraded. 

Best regards,

Jason, Head of Easyrabbit Marketing Team
